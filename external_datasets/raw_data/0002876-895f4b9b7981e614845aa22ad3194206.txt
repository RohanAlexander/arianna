Welcome to

We are on kickstarter to raise awareness of our cause and our brand. We will use everything we raise on the business and on establishing our brand to make our vision a reality.

Clothing is a basic essential that so far our society has mainly used for style or the eyes of others. To tell others who we are or who we want to be. We wear our clothes all day and that message radiates outward the whole time. Until you look in a mirror.





Sending a Message Inside

We believe that clothing is the perfect medium and opportunity for sending a message inside to ourselves. We will keep fashion designs with plenty of style but simply add a reverse image of a message. A message that touches you in a meaningful way every time you look in the mirror or take a selfie. Whether that message is Positive Reinforcement, A Personal Reminder, Internal Fire, etc. Whatever the case may be, you decide what kind of message works best for the betterment of yourself.





Our main goal is to put a bigger importance on who we are on the inside as opposed to how we are perceived on the outside. We want to build this brand for children and teenagers because their minds are still developing. Especially when starting young, we can use clothing as another method of teaching good traits and qualities, even when we can't always be there. Our brand can also help young adults and above. To whom we serve positive reminders, or simple qualities that we may not always remember.
