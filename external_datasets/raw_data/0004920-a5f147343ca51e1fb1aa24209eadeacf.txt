I am surprised by the apparent interest in ‘musigh’ tees, but I think it’s doable. The question is the design though: would you prefer just ‘musigh’ with the original font, or just the ‘m’, or a different font, or maybe a tagline or some kind of picture/logo? Should it be large in the middle, or something smaller aligned to the side?

There are many possibilities, so please share your thoughts. I would like keep the price to the bare minimum (i.e. production costs) for everyone, so I am thinking something I could make with my sub-decent photoshop skillz, or if you submit your own work, please only do if you are content with a heartfelt thank you in exchange.

The expected price from Redbubble tees is around $20-25 + shipping. If you know a better/cheaper custom tree pressing company (preferably with international shipping and single/on-demand production) please let me know.

Last but not least, here are some superb sounds for you to pleasure your ears with.
