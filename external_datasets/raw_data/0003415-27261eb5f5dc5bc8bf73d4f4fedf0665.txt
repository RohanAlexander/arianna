The story is a rich one with themes of remembrance and loss, incorporating mad moon rulers, feuding immortal sisters and magic formed from emotional bonds... so it's rather up my alley. Plus it has a sword wielding protector monkey, an archer beetle (or a beetle archer?), legendary swords and armor, epic origami and more all wrapped up in an engaging hero's quest. It really is a fun and touching time at the theater that I can't recommend enough!

This one is a bit unexpected, I'm sure... I had been looking forward to seeing "Kubo and the Two Strings" ever since I sawFor a glimpse of the encounter above, check out the video for the film's cover of "While My Guitar Gently Weeps" , and see this film if you get the chance... It's playing now in the US, has gotten rave reviews and is sure to get a Best Animated Feature nomination at next year's Oscars, yet it is not getting near the attention that I think it deserves.
