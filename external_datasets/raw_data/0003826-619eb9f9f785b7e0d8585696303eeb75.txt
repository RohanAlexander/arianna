If you don’t live within an hour of the Village of Lake Placid in the Adirondack North Country, then you’d better hurry up and get in your car or on your bike. Now. This haste is required if you want to catch the free Rusted Root concert scheduled for 7:00 p.m. tonight on Mirror Lake in Lake Placid.

Tonight’s concert is part of the Songs at Mirror Lake Music Series, a seven week summer concert series highlighting an array of local, regional, and national musical talent hosted at the scenic setting of Mids Park, on the shore of Mirror Lake, Main Street in Lake Placid.

Songs at Mirror Lake is a volunteer, not for profit organization that features emerging artists in a variety of musical genres. The concerts are held on Tuesday evenings from 7:00-9:00pm during July and August and all are free to the public.

Oh and we’ll need you to chant, “Rain, rain, go away!” so the concert can be held outside as planned.
