WESTSIDE ADOPTION CENTER: I’m at LexiDog on 6100 SW Macadam Ave. Portland, OR 97239 (503-327-8219). I romp and play all day with the other dogs in doggy daycare so I might be a great fit with your canine family members! Looking for a lap dog? Well, guess what? I’m looking for a lap. I’m easy going, sweet, and I get along with most everyone. No point in you looking any further! I think I’m pretty close to perfect. If you can provide me with daily exercise, routine, and a little bit of training, I think I could be a great match for you. You know what sounds like fun? Taking a Basic Manners class, like the one here at OHS; training and treats, sounds good to me! I’m one of the lucky ones who came from Merced Co. Animal Control to OHS through the Second Chance Program.

The adoption fee includes spay/neuter, microchip ID, collar and OHS I.D. tag, initial vaccines, courtesy veterinarian exam, 30 days free PetPlan health insurance and plenty of post adoption support!
