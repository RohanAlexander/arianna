Photos and Video of Derek Fisher DUI Crash Released…He’s Lucky to Be Alive (Pics + Video)

Video Playback Not Supported

Judging from the newly released photos of his wrecked SUV, Derek Fisher and girlfriend Gloria Govan are lucky to be alive.

Fisher was behind the wheel of his 2015 Cadillac Escalade when he crashed into a guard rail on the 101 freeway in Los Angeles around 3 a.m. on Sunday morning. The vehicle flipped, but thankfully both he and Govan were buckled in and the airbags deployed, likely saving their lives. Both walked away without injury.

TMZ obtained photos of the SUV, which suffered major damage on both the driver and passenger sides. Take a look:

TMZ also obtained video footage of the crash site shot by someone driving by early Sunday morning:

I’d say Matt Barnes must be loving this, except he probably isn’t. More likely his anger at Fisher is at an all-time high. Now, not only did Fisher “steal” his girl, the mother of his children, he almost killed her by driving drunk.

Of course, Fisher now has much bigger problems than Matt Barnes. He’s facing a serious DUI charge that could derail whatever chance he had of getting another NBA coaching gig.
