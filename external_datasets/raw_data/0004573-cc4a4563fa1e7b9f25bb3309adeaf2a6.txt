Strange things happen when suddenly my SAI went down. You see a Picture for but what you see is not what was original. I managed somehow to let SAI crashed in the middle of saving my picture. After starting my PC new and open SAI again, the picture is god thanks there where it belongs. But suddenly it has only one layer and many effects are missing or completing to much. Also the whole color schematic changed to only red like colors.For me and Kooner it doesn't look bad, we like it, but after all the original picture is missing and I also can't edit it to the original. So here it is, the new version. XDThis is Autumn Leaves a OC from The first picture of two for him. A gift picture for one of my best friends here._______________________________________________
