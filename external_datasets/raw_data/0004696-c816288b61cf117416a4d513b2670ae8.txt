Bianca and Nick Bowser, their sons Kai, 3, and Pax, 17 months, from Louisville Kentucky, were stealth until they came out on national television Friday. They don’t believe it will be an issue for their children with the way human rights has been progressing nationally.

Transgender rights have been moving forward, but the progress has been limited without national laws.

Kentucky has one high school with a transgender inclusive policy and one-state lawmaker who’s hell-bent on putting a $2,500 bounty on transgender students.
