About

There are many things in life that... just plain suck. Someone cuts you off in traffic, the garbage bag breaks, you spill coffee on your junk in the car or someone at work eats your lunch that you clearly labeled before placing in the fridge (that jerk).

I have found writing angry haikus to be a great way to deal with these things. Sometimes I even doodle the events. I have collected quite a few of these angry haikus over the past year. I have decided I want to share them with you so I am publishing a book.

The book is a 5x7 96 page full color semi-gloss paperback. Every haiku is handwritten and scanned to be digitally placed in the book.
