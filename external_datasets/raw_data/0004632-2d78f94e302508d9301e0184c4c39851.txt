The Board will announce the team only after the ICC Board meeting, where the controversial revenue and governance reforms will be put to vote, ends on April 27.

The Board has been keeping pressure on the ICC with its right to exercise the Members Participation Agreement (MPA) that gives it the right to pull out of the tournament in case of disagreement.

While BCCI is in discussion with various boards, the discussion between BCCI and Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) over the bilateral series issue could resume at the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) meeting to be held on Tuesday in Dubai.

PCB has vehemently opposed the structure that guarantees BCCI a major share after the latter did not honour bilateral commitments.
