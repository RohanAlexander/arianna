Research suggests the majority of women arrested in domestic violence incidents are themselves victims of ongoing abuse from their male partner.

The research, by the anti domestic violence group Shine, analysed the arrests of 60 women in Auckland City between April and September last year.

The report's author, Deborah MacKenzie, says of 35 women who assaulted their male partners, 19 used violence in response to ongoing abuse.

Dual arrests, where both parties are taken into custody, featured in nine out of the 35 cases.

Ms MacKenzie says this indicates the police sometimes have difficulty in identifying who the dangerous person is in the relationship.

She says officers should be trained to identify which party is most at risk.

Ms MacKenzie says in some cases men want to be the first person to call police, knowing they will be treated as the victim rather than the offender.
