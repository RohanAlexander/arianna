VIDEO: Revenge-seeking crows terrorize an Istanbul neighborhood

ISTANBUL

A murder of crows has been attacking passersby for almost a week in an Istanbul neighborhood, creating scenes reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock’s 1963 masterpiece ”The Birds.”A nestling was killed under the wheels of a car last week, after it fell from its nest on top of a utility pole in Istanbul’s Asian-side neighborhood of Ümraniye. Since then, crows have been attacking people to avenge the death and protect the remaining nestlings.In addition to people who are regularly being hit on their heads, cats are being victimized by the rage of the crows as well. “They generally attack older people. We’re also afraid, but they haven’t attacked us,” one of the children who have to use the road every day to go to a nearby school told Cihan News Agency.
