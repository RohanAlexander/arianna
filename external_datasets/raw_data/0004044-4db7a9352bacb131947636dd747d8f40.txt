This issue is caused by the Irish servers. Our clan server is for some reason migrating every evening to Ireland from Netherlands, DICE or EA hasn't given us any answer why it's doing this. When the server is in Ireland the server is lagging and rubberbanding so much that it makes the game unplayable. Is it then that Irish servers are routed badly?
