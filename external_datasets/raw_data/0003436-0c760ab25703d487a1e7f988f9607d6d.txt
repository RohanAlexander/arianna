What’s up my dudes & dudettes?

Often when the darkest timeline is upon us, the aggro players go back to their most powerful tool: Burn Spells. So this week I take Stonescar Burn for a spin!

Stonescar Burn isn’t a new deck, and has survived many a nerf while still remaining a top dog in the metagame. Nerfs such as Champion of Chaos not getting +1/+1 for the thresholds, Rapid Shot costing 1S, Soulfire Drake costing 5FF, and so on. Despite all that, Stonescar is still a good choice. By applying early pressure with efficient aggro units and having extra burn reach with spells like Torch and Obliterate it maintains a good presence regardless of what the meta throws its way.

Yes we were unlucky some points but these games show the strength of the deck. We had some opponents stumble, and we were able to close the door on them. We had other opponents give us some good games while allowing us to make some meaningful decisions. If you’re looking for a deck that will jam out games quickly and has a reasonable win percentage, I can’t recommend Stonescar Burn enough.

As always you can give me comments/questions on Reddit, the Discord, or Twitter @jwiley129. Thanks so much for following along and I’ll see y’all next time!
