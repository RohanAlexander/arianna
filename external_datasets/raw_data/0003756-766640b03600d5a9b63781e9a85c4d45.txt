The Army on Friday released the name of a soldier who died Saturday from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.

Maj. Troy Donn Wayman, 44, was found in his home in Nolanville, Texas, near Fort Hood. He was pronounced dead by Bell County Justice of the Peace Bill Cooke shortly after 10 p.m. Saturday, according to the statement from First Army Division West officials.

Wayman's death has been ruled a suicide, according to the death report prepared by the Southwestern Institute of Forensic Sciences in Dallas. The report was released to Army Times via an open records request.

Wayman, who was from Lincoln, Nebraska, began his career in the Nebraska Army National Guard, joining in August 1989 as an armor cannon crewman. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant and entered active-duty service in May 1998. He had been assigned to First Army Division West, on Fort Hood, since October 2014.

"This is a terrible loss, and we are grieving the loss of this valued teammate," said Maj. Gen. Jeffrey Colt, commanding general of First Army Division West, in a statement. "We remain fully committed to supporting Maj. Wayman's family and friends and want to reinforce no one should ever feel like they're alone or without our support."

Wayman served two tours in Saudi Arabia, including during Desert Shield and Desert Storm. He also deployed twice to Iraq and once to Kosovo.
