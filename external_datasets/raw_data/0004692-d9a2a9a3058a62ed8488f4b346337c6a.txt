Last week, I was scouting some studio spaces in a Chelsea office building when I happened to notice a vacant office across the hall.

Normally, I wouldn’t have given it a second thought, except something in the room happened to catch my eye…

…was that a subway car inside??

It was a subway car! Or at least, a pretty creative replica of one…

…right down to those chains they always have at the front…

…and the yellow warning line on the platform:

The train is actually divided inside into a series of offices…

…each equipped with sliding stainless-steel doors:

Doing some quick research, I learned that this used to be the offices of B-Train Films (which pretty much explains everything), a production company specializing in sports production (they’ve since moved on to a new office space).

Very curious to see if the next tenants decide to keep their very own indoor subway train.
