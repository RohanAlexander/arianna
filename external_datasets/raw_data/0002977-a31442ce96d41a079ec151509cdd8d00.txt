In his book, "The Clintons' War on Women," high-profile Donald Trump campaign strategist and noted conspiracy theorist Roger Stone claims Chelsea Clinton — daughter of Democratic nominee Hillary and former-President Bill — had four plastic surgeries in order to look less like her biological father, Webb Hubbell.

Promoting the book in what looks like a hotel banquet hall over the weekend, Stone reasons, "Hillary admits in her own book that a large football player-sized man taught her the proper way to hold a baby. Who could that be?"

Hubbell — who was associate attorney general during Clinton's presidency — played offensive tackle for the University of Arkansas Razorbacks and was drafted by the Chicago Bears before a knee injury ended his career.

"And if you look at her, she doesn’t look anything like Bill," Stone continued. "She looks just like her daddy, despite four plastic surgeries, the youngest one when she’s only 18. What 18-year-old gets plastic surgery unless you’re trying to, I don’t know, thin out the lips and make you look less like your daddy?"
