The Washington Post has won a Gerald Loeb award for a series of stories that exposed the extent of the National Security Agency’s massive global surveillance programs.

The Loeb awards, generally considered the top prize in business journalism, were announced at a dinner in New York on Tuesday night. The Post submitted five stories from its coverage of secret NSA programs, which were based on classified documents leaked by Edward Snowden, the former government contractor who is living in exile in Russia.

The articles, written by Barton Gellman, Laura Poitras, Ellen Nakashima, Craig Timberg, Steven Rich and Ashkan Soltani, won in the category of large newspapers.

The Loebs honored two other Post projects. “The Cost of Healing,” written by Peter Whoriskey and Dan Keating, which examined Medicare’s flawed pricing system, was named as a finalist in the explanatory category. “Tax Liens: Left With Nothing,” by Debbie Cenziper, Michael Sallah and Steven Rich, which revealed that the District was allowing companies to seize houses from distressed homeowners or charge them exorbitant fees, was a finalist in the investigative category.
