So much thought and care was put into this exchange! I was contacted by the Gifter several times and assured that everything was getting ready.

I've received amazing handmade reddit coaster! So cool, so thoughtful and caring :) Lots of evidence of good stalking skills: r/aww and r/cats! Game of Thrones book - my latest obsession and a lovely set of stationery items - notebooks and pens - all so cute and very "me". Oh, I must not forget the sweets which were gone in seconds!

I told HistoryMaker118 that I will open the package after I get back from holidays - this was yesterday and the photostory below shows my wonderful adventure. My kitten Lluan was very curious and personally examined each gift!

Thank you very very much!
