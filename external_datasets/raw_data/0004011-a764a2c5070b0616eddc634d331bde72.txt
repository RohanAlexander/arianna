[1] Sobers held the record for the second highest number of centuries in Test cricket at the time of his retirement.

Sir Garfield Sobers (also known as Gary Sobers) is a former international cricketer who represented the West Indies cricket team between 1954 and 1974. He scored centuries (100 or more runs in an innings) on 26 occasions. Widely acknowledged as the "greatest all-rounder",[1][2][3] he was described by Australian cricketer Don Bradman as a "five-in-one cricketer".[N 1] Sobers played 93 Tests, aggregating 8,032 runs at a batting average of 57.78, and claimed 235 wickets as a bowler.[3] He held the record for most runs in a career in Test cricket until 1981.[N 2] Sobers was named one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1964, and one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Century in 2000.[6] He entered into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame when the International Cricket Council (ICC) formally inducted him alongside 55 initial inductees in 2009.[7]

Sobers made his Test debut against Pakistan in 1954, and scored his first century against the same team four years later. He became the youngest player to complete a triple century when he made 365 not out in that match.[8] It remained the highest individual score in Test cricket for 36 years until transcended by Brian Lara in 1994.[9] The innings is also the highest maiden century by a batsman in Tests.[10] In the fourth Test of the same series Sobers went on to score centuries in both the innings, ending the series with 824 runs at an average of 137.33.[11] He was most successful against England, scoring 10 centuries.[12] Sobers made scores of 150 or more in a Test match innings on thirteen occasions, and was dismissed five times between scores of 90 and 99.[13] As of January 2013, he is fourteenth in the all-time century-makers in Test cricket, and third in the equivalent list for the West Indies.[14]

Sobers made his solitary One Day International (ODI) appearance in a match against England in September 1973;[15] he was dismissed for a duck.[15]
