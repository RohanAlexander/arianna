Playboy magazine today crowned the University of Colorado the nation’s No. 1 party school, citing the Boulder campus’ annual 4/20 smokeout, as well as the city’s numerous medical-marijuana dispensaries and its status as “a beer drinker’s paradise.”

According to Playboy’s website , CU received the party school crown because:

“CU-Boulder is home to reefer madness. Not only does Boulder have 50 medical-marijuana dispensaries within its city limits, but every April nearly half the university’s 24,000-plus undergrads turn out for the annual 4/20 smoke-out on school grounds. Boulder is also a beer drinker’s paradise, with four breweries in town. ‘There are a lot of distractions from school-snowboarding, mountain biking, super hot girls,’ says one alum. Literally dozens of world-class ski resorts are a drive away. You know Boulder is a party school because whenever you tell someone that you went there, the first thing they ask is, ‘Did you graduate?'”
