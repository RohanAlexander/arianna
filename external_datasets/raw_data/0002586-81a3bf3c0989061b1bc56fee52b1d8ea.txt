Reading Steiner:

REFERENCE-OGRAPHY

PUNOGRAPHY:

So, when you go back in time in "Life is Strange", you technically bring anyone who died a few seconds ago back from the dead, right? What if those people'sdon't come back with them? What if they just came back as empty husks with a few base instincts, like cannibalism (the basest of all human instincts, of course)? And if souls aren't affected by time-travel, then logically, fungus isn't either, because souls and fungus are in the same biological kingdom (duh), which means that whenever you go back in time in "Life is Strange", fungus is able to evolve more and more until something that used to only be able to infect insects jumps to infecting mammals -- even humans. The evolution would seem so sudden to anyone without the Reading Steiner* as the fungus makes its way into food delivered to the masses and infects the human species on a global scale.So, when you go back in time in "Life is Strange"... what are youdoing?1. An awareness of temporal re-experience2. The ability to recognize that you have undergone a nonstandard passing of time3. Knowing that you have gone back in time, but also retaining your memory from the original timelineThe red-headed girl, Ellie, is from "The Last of Us" which spawned my first parody series, "THE LEAST OF US" (look out for spoilers).The two with the gun, Lee and Clem, are from "The Walking Dead Game", which I've also made cartoons for called "THE WALK-IN DEAD" (also spoilers).The title is a pun on the term "temporal anomaly", which is a disruption in the space-time continuum usually resulting from time-travel or something like that.
