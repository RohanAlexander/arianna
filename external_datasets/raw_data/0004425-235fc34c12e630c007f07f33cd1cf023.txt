Yesterday I attended the start of Kelvin Davis’ Hikoi against sexual violence. He is intending to walk from Waitakere to Cape Reinga over the next two weeks, and stopping in towns and settlements on the way to talk about sexual violence.

His message is clear, men need to own the violence problem that is a plague on our community.

In his own words:

Our group’s name is Men Against Sexual Violence and we’re encouraging all men to speak out about this evil lurking within our communities which is the violence towards men, women and children. We don’t want it swept under the carpet, let’s protect our families.”

The launch attracted representation from all of the political parties. Labour had a full contingent, the Greens were well represented with David Clendon, Steffan Browning and Jan Logie attending, and New Zealand First’s latest MP Ria Bond came all the way from Invercargill to be present. The Maori Party’s Marama Fox was there. Even Act’s David Seymour turned up. He gave a rather bizarre speech about the importance of liberty but at least he showed up. National was represented by Alfred Ngaro who spoiled the effect by turning up late but again at least he was there.

Following is the itinerary. Click on it for a more legible version. If you are in the area I am sure Kelvin will be happy to talk to you.

Kelvin will be posting photos and updates on his own Facebook page and on the Massive Facebook page.
