Where Kanye West and Jay Z are concerned, there are a lot of rumors surrounding them. Much like he said on his 2005 hit, “Diamonds From Sierra Leone,” it seems like they are “praying for the death of their dynasty, like amen.” They have pinned their hopes on TIDAL.

When it comes to business, Jay Z has experienced all types of success over the past two decades. These decades have seen Jay Z launch various music-related businesses. His latest venture is TIDAL, a partnership with the likes of Kanye, Beyonce, J. Cole, Nicki Minaj, Usher, and many others.

Since then, Kanye West has faced rumors of trying to distance himself from TIDAL, due to it being perceived as a failure. There were even rumors of Kanye West leaving Roc Nation, but it turned out he fired his manager within the company. Now, there are rumors of Kanye West premiering his new album on Apple Music, as opposed to TIDAL.
