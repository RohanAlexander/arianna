SEATTLE -- Taking a partisan view of Donald Trump's lewd comments about women, Washington State Republican Party Chairman Susan Hutchison said Friday night that the GOP presidential nominee's "indecent comments in 2005 ... were made when he was a Democrat."

She added, "The hypocrisy of Hillary Clinton to say Trump does not belong in the White House when her husband defined this behavior."

Hutchison tweeted her statements after she reportedly told a Seattle news outlet that 11 years ago, Trump was channeling Bill Clinton with his crude comments at the time.

Meanwhile, the highest-ranking Republican woman in Congress, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington state, has condemned Trump's crude comments.

Multiple news outlets are reporting that in a Friday evening statement McMorris Rodgers said, "It is never appropriate to condone unwanted sexual advances or violence against women." She also said, "Mr. Trump must realize that it has no place in public or private conversations."

She did not say she would withdraw her support for the Republican presidential candidate, to whom she had given a lukewarm endorsement.

In a debate earlier this week, McMorris Rodgers said she would vote for Trump and praised his acumen as a businessman.
