Enter Shadar Logoth. There are some really nice descriptions of the architecture of this ruined city.

How do you picture the characters?

The boys slip out the back of the warded shelter without permission to explore the empty city. As night approaches, they encounter Mordeth. We get into the motivations of this dangerous character.

Matt picks up the ruby hilted dagger during their flight, but tells no one.

After they return Rand has a dream. Is the old man in it Ishmael?

The approach of Tollocs forces the party to flee.
