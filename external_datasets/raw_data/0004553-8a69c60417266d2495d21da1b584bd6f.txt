Footage of the show shows her wearing a revealing red bra and skirt as she shimmies around and flicks her hair back and forth.

As she throws her head forwards, she loses her wig but manages to grab it.

She tries to put it back on her head as she continues her moves but to no avail.

The black wig then falls the floor behind her as she carries on her routine, all too aware of the mishap.

Afterwards the laughing star took the incident in her stride, saying it was not the first time she had been caught out on live television.

She recalled how she was doing a routine once when her hot pants fell down during a show in Aguascalientes, Mexico.

She said: 'I am laughing. You have to. If my hot pants fall too I have to start laughing. It is an issue that comes with the job.'

Lyn was born in Mexico but her Chinese ancestry is said to have captivated Mexicans in the 70s.
