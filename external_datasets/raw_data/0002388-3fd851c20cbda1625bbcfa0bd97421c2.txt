Two Michigan state senators are pushing a bill to allow pharmacies to sell medical marijuana—if the federal government approves—the Detroit Free Press reported last week.

“The voters decided that medical marijuana was a good thing for the state of Michigan, but unfortunately, very few parameters were put around that,” Republican Senator Randy Richardville told the paper.

Most interestingly, Prairie Plant Systems—the company that held the sole contract to produce medical pot for the Canadian government until recent changes in that country’s medical marijuana program—is lobbying hard for the bill. The company hired Chuck Perricone, a former state house speaker, to move the medical marijuana bill forward. “The market for this is virtually untapped. The potential for the product is tremendous,” Perricone told DFP.

But patient advocates are skeptical of the corporate pharmacy pot push. “If you’re able to grow in your basement there’s no reason to go to Walmart,” Americans for Safe Access chapter spokesman Rick Thompson told the Associated Press. He suggested the goal of the bill is to eliminate patient home growing rights in Michigan, and said such a move is against the spirit of the medical cannabis law approved by voters in 2008.
