My santa hit every possible mark this year! I'm so thankful to my SS!

Not only did I recieve a new sketch book with some pencil sets, as well as a literal pile of notebooks to write in, I also got two new dice sets to replace the ones my cats have been trying to decimate by spreading them under every piece of furniture in the house! I love the colors and can't wait to see how well they roll!

And speaking of those two troublesome devils, Avi Cadavi and Kiddy Kricket absolutely love their gifts! Kricket has laid claim to the crinkle tube and has been wrestling with it on and off all day! Avi adores swatting his catnip-filled jingle ball, but he also seems to enjoy swatting it under the couch! Heaven only knows how long it'll be till it vanishes!

I'm saving their third gift- a literal TON of cat drugs- for Christmas.

Thank you again Santa! You nailed it!
