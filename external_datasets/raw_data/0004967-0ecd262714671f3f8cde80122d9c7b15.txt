CBS 7 Sports has learned that Andrews Girls Golf Coach Mark Burgen has been suspended after attending golf practice last Friday.

According to an Andrews Police Report, Burgen committed a Class C misdemeanor offense of using of wireless communication device in a school crossing zone or while operating a school bus with a minor passenger.

The misdemeanor offense has now led to his possible suspension from his duties of head golf coach.

In statement released to the Andrews County News, Andrews Superintendent Bobby Azam said “Andrews ISD cannot comment on individual student or personal matters. However, as always, the district’s primary purpose is the safety and security of all AISD students, faculty and staff. Therefore, the district will continue to take appropriate actions to ensure their safety and well being.”

When CBS 7 reached out to the six-time state champion, Burgen said he would not be able to comment on the matter.

There is now a petition going around the internet to reinstate Burgen at head golf coach.
