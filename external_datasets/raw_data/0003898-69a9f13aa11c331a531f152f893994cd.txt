Conservative Reporter Posobiec Assaulted by Violent Left-Wing Antifa Member at DC Protest (VIDEO)

Washington D.C. â€“ Rebel Media reporter, Jack Posobiec was assaulted by a member of Antifa as he was reporting on the â€˜May Dayâ€™ protests. Antifa is out in full force today and admittedly preparing for violence.

As usual, left-wing Antifa members are the violent ones who donâ€™t believe in freedom of speech or freedom of the press. Jack Posobiec was assaulted by this man simply because he is a reporter with different views.
