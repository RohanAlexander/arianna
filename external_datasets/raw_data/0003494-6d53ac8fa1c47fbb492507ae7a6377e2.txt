Production is due to start early next year on the long-awaited follow-up to Anchorman, with Will Ferrell and Steve Carell leading the returning cast. Entitled Anchorman: The Legend Continues, Adam McKay is directing again too, with the plan being to release the film before 2013 is out.

The further plan also seems to add a new love interest to the movie, and The Wrap is reporting that Kristen Wiig is in talks to take on the role. She would "play opposite Steve Carell", which suggests that it's Brick who will be finding romance. Crikey.

Wiig, whose biggest hit to date has been Bridesmaids (which she co-wrote), would join the likes of Christina Applegate and Paul Rudd in the cast.
