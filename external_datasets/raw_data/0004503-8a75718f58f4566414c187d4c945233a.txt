Especially if the Lebanese are having a counter protest at the same time.We don't know how the Syrians in custody died. We don't know if they were really terrorists, or unfortunate souls who got swept away, by mistake, along with real terrorists. It is understandable that their families feel the way they do. However, it's a miracle that the LAF, ISF, and HA were able to prevent the Syrian war from crossing into our borders, without more violent clashes with the refugees. Especially that members of these forces, as well as Lebanese civilians, were kidnapped and killed by terrorists hiding among those refugees.And, all this, with the government in the state it was, and with a ratio of one refugee for every two Lebanese nationals, in a country that can't even provide water and electricity reliably. Any other country in Lebanon's situation would have descended into chaos by now.Inshallah the war in Syria is over soon and they all go back home to rebuild their homes and communities, before the situation in Lebanon deteriorates further. Lebanon has enough issues to deal with on its own.
