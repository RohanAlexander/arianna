[Editor's note: Ohio State has asked us to remove the video of OSU's QBs at the scrimmage from publication. Our apologies.]

How did Ohio State's top-three quarterbacks -- J.T. Barrett, Joe Burrow and Dwayne Haskins -- look during Saturday's student appreciation day scrimmage?

In a word, they were sharp. Not perfect by any means or even close, but it was an encouraging day for the Buckeye QBs.

Burrow is the clear backup to Barrett, but Haskins is also looking good. Barrett, Burrow and Haskins were all wearing black no-contact jerseys, while Tate Martell was live.

For much more on how the QBs performed during the scrimmage between the offense and defense, which ended in a 16-16 tie, check out our practice thread that was posted earlier on Saturday.
