Jason Bateman has described the plot of the upcoming Arrested Development movie as "incredible".

In an interview with MTV News, the actor - who played Michael Bluth in the Fox comedy series - admitted that while the script for the big-screen adaptation has yet to be completed, he feels confident that series creator Mitch Hurwitz will make sure the project comes to fruition soon.

"It's incredible. It's everything you would want it to be and more. I really hope he finishes it soon so we can have a shot of doing it before the end of the year," he said.

"For the very first time, [Mitch] sat me down last week to talk about what he's got and where he's going and what do I think. As a fan of the show, I was vibrating with excitement that he was pulling me behind the curtain. So I can confirm what his update was, which was that he is very deep into the work on it and the odds of him getting it done before the end of the year, as he says he wants to, are good."

Bateman went on to say that he is uncertain why it took the project so long to get off the ground, adding: "It is embarrassing. We are embarrassed."
