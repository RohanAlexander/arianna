An Army veteran is being credited with saving a bald eagle by shooting it out of a tree.

Jason Galvin was driving near his home in Minnesota when he saw the bird hanging upside down by a rope about 75 feet up.

After telling his wife Jackie, the couple decided something needed to be done so they started calling local officials.

According to Jackie, all of them gave the same answer, the bird had been stuck there for 2 and a half days and it was dead.

The Galvins believed the eagle was alive so Jackie encouraged her husband to shoot the rope the bird was tangled in.

Jason had to be careful since killing a bald eagle is a crime. He borrowed a neighbor's rifle and after an hour and a half and 150 bullets, the bird was loose. Galvin, who served 2 tours in Afghanistan, didn't hit the eagle once.

The couple named the bird Freedom, wrapped it in a blanket and it was taken to the Raptor Center where it's expected to make a full recovery.

Mission accomplished!
