A MELBOURNE woman has been reunited with her dog 10 years after it went missing.

Latte disappeared from Anne Quach’s Reservoir home in 2004, sparking a fruitless search.

“I bought Latte and her brother Cappuccino in 2003, and a year later Latte went missing from our yard,’’ Ms Quach said.

“We’re not sure if she was stolen or snuck out, but I was devastated and Cappuccino whined for weeks afterwards.”

At the time, Ms Quach put up posters in the hope someone would recognise the much-loved pooch, but she eventually gave up hope of being reunited.

Until now, when she turned up at the City of Whittlesea Pound in Epping where a microchip scan revealed the identity of her owner.

Latte was unkempt and slightly malnourished, but otherwise OK.

Ms Quach said Latte didn’t recognise her or respond to her name, but she was settling in well.

“Cappuccino is very happy and my son Vin, who was only a month old when she went missing, loves his new friend,’’ she said.

Whittlesea Council animal management team leader Rod Thickins said Ms Quach’s story was a timely reminder to microchip pets.

“Microchipping our cats and dogs has led to many happy reunions at the pound. Latte’s case is extraordinary — 10 years is definitely our council record,’’ he said.
