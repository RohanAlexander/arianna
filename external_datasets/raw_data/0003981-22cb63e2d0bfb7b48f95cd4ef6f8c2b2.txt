Remy has dropped diss tracks "ShETHER" and "Another One," which were aimed at the Barb. Now, she finally decided to speak her piece about the feud. The fact that Remy dressed like she was going to a funeral was also hilarious!

During the interview, Remy didn't hold back when she was talking about why she ethered Nicki not once, but twice. She admitted that she didn't care about the subliminal shots Nicki took of her on songs. It was actually the "behind the scenes things that you people will never know about." Remy said: "As far as trying to keep me off of red carpets, trying to make sure awards don't go to me or she's not going to be in attendance, trying to get people to make bad reports about my album sales-- just anything that I'm doing to make me look less and make her look better."

That's when the BX MC said, straight up, "When you're trying to stop my bag, when you're trying to stop me from taking care of my children, I have a problem with that."
