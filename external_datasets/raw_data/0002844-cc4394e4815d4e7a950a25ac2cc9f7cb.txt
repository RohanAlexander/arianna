Massachusetts Lawmaker Who Tipped Illegals Off to ICE Raids Says She’s Not Sorry

As reported earlier — Massachusetts State Representative, Michelle Dubois took to Facebook to warn illegal aliens that ICE would be doing raids in the community of Brockton on Wednesday, March 29th.

Ms. DuBois even gave specific instructions to illegal aliens to stay inside ‘don’t go out on the street’ and if there was a knock on the door, not to answer the door.

Michelle DuBois told CBS Local she is not sorry for her illegal stunt:

“Passing information along that is already all over the community not only lets the people I represent know what is happening. It lets ICE know that everyone in Brockton is aware of their intended raid if there was one,” DuBois said, reading a statement aloud. Asked whether she thought the post could be construed as obstructing justice, she replied, “No, I don’t.” DuBois also said she did not see a problem with disseminating a rumor and admitted, she did not contact ICE before doing so.

They need to start locking up a few of these criminals.

This lawmaker is out of control.
