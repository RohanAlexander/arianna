The latest update for The Sims 4 adds pools and other pool-related activities to the game.

The Build mode used for home creation has been adapted to pools, which should help streamline the pool-building process.

In addition to being created in Build mode, pools can also be built diagonally and on rooftops. Windows can be added to pools to create infinity pools, wall height can be adjusted to make deeper or shallower pools, and a slew of new swimwear has been added to the game as well. The new line of swimwear can be perused in Create A Sim.

Having a pool means that Sims can just sit around the pool and enjoy all that owning a pool entails, from swimming, to relaxing pool side, to getting splashed by other Sims. It also means the return of death by drowning, which means Sims ghosts may express their displeasure for water, on account of it being the cause of their untimely simulated demise.

In addition to pools, there are a number of bug fixes including the tweaking of some performance issues and graphical oddities.

The Sims 4 launched at the beginning of September and help propel EA to huge earnings in the second quarter of its fiscal year.
