2009 Paris-Roubaix runner up ready for Sunday after Sanremo and Flanders disappointment

Filippo Pozzato (Lampre-Merida) is taking aim at the third and final big target of his spring campaign, as he hopes to go one better than his 2009 second place in Sunday’s Paris-Roubaix. The 31-year-old Italian was active, but unsuccessful in Milano-Sanremo on March 17th, but less visible in last Sunday’s Ronde van Vlaanderen but, as the blue-fuchsia team’s Classics captain, he expects more in l’Enfer du Nord.



“Paris-Roubaix is a very demanding and selecting race, the group of the pretenders is even more limited than at the Ronde van Vlaanderen,” Pozzato explained. “I focused the early part of the season to three targets: Milano-Sanremo, the Ronde van Vlaanderen and Paris-Roubaix. I’ve got one last chance to be a protagonist, after not having hit the targets in the first two appointments.



“Of course, I’ll need to be more competitive than past Sunday, because Paris-Roubaix must be approached with energy and a clear mind.”



After such taking such a dominant victory in Sunday’s Ronde, there will be one rider that Pozzato - and the rest of the peloton - will be watching across the fearsome cobbles of northern France.



“[Fabian] Cancellara will have all eyes on him,” Pozzato confirmed. “He is the logical favourite.”



Friday will see Pozzato reconnoitre most of the cobbled sectors, starting from sector 19 [of 27 - ed] between Haveluy à Wallers and riding all the way to section 4 at Le Carrefour de l'Arbre. The Italian team will be riding a new Rida frame from bike sponsor Merida, which has been specifically designed for tough, cobbled races like Paris-Roubaix.
