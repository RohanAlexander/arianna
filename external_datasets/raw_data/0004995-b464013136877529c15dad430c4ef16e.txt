A strip club employee was stabbed in the torso in downtown Ottawa Tuesday night, and hours later another man was found stabbed on Montreal Road.

The first stabbing happened at Barbarella's Cabaret, near the intersection of Queen and Lyon streets, just before 11 p.m.

An argument inside the club led to an altercation outside, where the stabbing occurred, according to police spokesman Const. Chuck Benoit. The victim is a man who was working as a security guard for the club.

The 44-year-old suffered a penetrating stab wound and was taken to hospital. Paramedics did not release his condition but his injuries were not considered life-threatening.

A man was taken into custody and charges are pending.

Montreal Road stabbing

Then, at about 5:45 a.m., a man was found stabbed in the parking lot of a business on Montreal Road near the Vanier Parkway.

He was taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.

Investigators believe the stabbing occurred elsewhere, Benoit said.

No arrests have been made.
