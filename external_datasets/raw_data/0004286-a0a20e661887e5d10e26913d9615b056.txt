Roy Sexton, a Saline resident, has been cast as one of the principals in “Legally Blonde the Musical,” a show that will be presented by the Farmington Players beginning April 26.



Sexton – vice president of marketing and planning for Trott & Trott, PC, a real estate law firm in Metro Detroit – will portray Callahan, the pompous and scheming head of the law firm that hires Elle Woods as a summer intern. The 2007 Tony-nominated musical is based on the 2001 Reese Witherspoon film from MGM. Callahan was played by Victor Garber in the movie. The Farmington Players’ production opens April 26 and runs through May 18. Tickets can be purchased at www.farmingtonplayers.org or by calling (248) 553-2955.



Sexton most recently had the lead role of Georg Nowack in last summer’s production of “She Loves Me” with Ann Arbor’s The Penny Seats, a theatre company he co-founded. He also has appeared in “Goodnight Desdemona,” “Oklahoma,” “Bells are Ringing,” “The Taming of the Shrew,” “Fiddler on the Roof,” “The Fantasticks,” among other productions. He also is an active cabaret performer, and he holds a master’s in theatre from Ohio State University.

In 2007, Sexton, a graduate of Wabash College, received his MBA from the University of Michigan.
