The idea of a cheesecake came to me naturally, I will have made an ice cream but I still have no turbine in my house (yes it is a call: D)

And because a cheesecake with the jam of milk it was not enough greedy (I am very greedy) I thought to a cheesecake on a base of pretzels, a cream cheese to the jam of milk, caramel icing with salted butter with mascarpone chantilly rosettes. (Gold-gas-nomic)



It's up to you to test the recipe now;)
