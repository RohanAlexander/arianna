Crowdfunding online company GoFundMe has banned The Glazov Gang, a web-tv show that tells the truth about the threat from the Left and Islam, from accepting online donations.

GoFundMe suspended The Glazov Gang campaign without any notice or explanation, nor have they responded to any queries.

This conduct by GoFundMe is part of its larger effort to shut down the efforts of Anni Cyrus, the producer of The Glazov Gang. Recently, also with no notice or explanation, GoFundMe deleted Anni’s entire account while she was raising funds for her anti-Sharia tour — wiping out all of her donor history and four open campaigns, one of which was The Glazov Gang campaign.

This development is part of a current onslaught by companies who are closing their platforms to those who dissent from the Left’s totalitarian worldview. Freedom of speech and conscience are being annihilated each passing day right before our eyes.

The Glazov Gang will not take this lying down. Please spread the message that GoFundMe has surrendered to leftist fascism and kindly write to the organization to request that The Glazov Gang get its campaign back:

Cyrus also confirmed that GoFundMe had removed her account in a post on Facebook, where she has over 20,000 followers.

“Dear supporters, today, with no notice or explanation, GoFundMe has deleted my entire account, wiping out all of my donor history, and four open campaigns,” Cyrus claimed. “You can help me by writing a brief email note to GoFundMe Customer Service, to lobby them to restore my account history, at the very least.”

In 2015, GoFundMe removed a fundraising campaign for the family of a “Draw Muhammad” organizer, who went into hiding following violent threats, while last year, the platform removed a campaign which sought to raise funds for an advertisement linking failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to an anti-Israel author.

In the past, left-wing journalists and activists have also attempted to pressure the platform into removing fundraisers for events featuring former Breitbart Senior Editor Milo Yiannopoulos.

Following left-wing riots on President Trump’s inauguration day in January, where a limo owned by a Muslim immigrant was set on fire and destroyed by rioters, Trump supporters raised nearly $24,000 for the man using GoFundMe.
