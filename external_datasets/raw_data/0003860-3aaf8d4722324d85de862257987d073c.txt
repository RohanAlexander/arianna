Serving up Mad Style Coat Porn:

Mad Men cast members Elisabeth Moss, John Slattery, Christina Hendricks, January Jones and Jon Hamm with show creator, writer and executive producer Matthew Weiner at THE DRAPER BENCH, a semi-permanent art installation at the Time & Life Plaza, 1271 Avenue of the Americas, home of Sterling Cooper & Partners Advertising Agency in the iconic series at Time & Life Building in New York City.

How ridiculously cool is that bench? How many tens of thousands of tourists are going to take their picture on that? How adorable are those socks?

They all look so cute here. We don’t think we’ve ever seen the cast all look that good at the same time. There’s usually one or two total WTFs, when you’ve got Hendricks, Jones, and Moss to contend with. God bless them all, but they’ve each had a somewhat contentious relationship with the red carpet.

Ironically, given the quintessentially New York flavor of the show, it’s fun and refreshing to see them all dressed up like, well, New Yorkers. Really glamorous and good-looking ones, to be sure.

That is just plain awesome, but it makes us really sad, in a way. We’re looking at a long mourning period ahead of us.
