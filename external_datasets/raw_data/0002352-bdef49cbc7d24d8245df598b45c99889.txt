THEY spend hours wearing orange makeup and rigid smiles, trying to sell over-hyped items to viewers.

But would you buy from someone who doesn’t know the Moon is a moon?

An unbelievable video has emerged showing two hosts from US shopping channel QVC discussing what the moon could be.

Showing off a hideous patterned cardigan, Jane Treacy says: “It kind of looks like what the Earth looks like when you’re a bazillion miles away from the planet Moon.”

Her co-host, designer Isaac Mizrahi, chimes in, thoughtfully. “The planet Moon...”

Realising her mistake, Ms Treacy tries again. “Isn’t the Moon a star?”

“The Moon is a planet, darling,” Mr Mizrahi corrects her.

But she’s sharper than that. “Is the Moon really a planet?” she demands. “Don’t look at me like that. The Sun is a star ... Is the Sun not a star?”

Mr Mizrahi replies: “I don’t know what the Sun is.”

They get into an argument, with Ms Treacy insisting the Moon is not a planet, and both pleading with viewers to Google the answer.

“So what else is it?” Mr Mizrahi asks, stumped.

“I believe it’s a star ... or something,” Ms Treacy answers.

Looking a little sheepish, she adds: “I feel like sometimes, though I am educated, I expose in this show that this blonde could be real.”

Viewers of the clip on YouTube were incredulous.

“This should serve as inspiration,” wrote Troy. “The man who believes the Moon is a planet ‘that things live on’ is a millionaire who was a household name in the 90s for his eponymous fashion line. If he can do it, we all can.”

YouTube user paddles409 added: “The moon is a hollow, artificial satellite inhabited by giant, superior, hyperintelligent, ants. Hail Ants!”

MrJohn2010 was more despairing, calling it a “shameful display of scientific illiteracy”.

For all the QVC hosts still confused: the Moon is a moon, a natural satellite that orbits a planet — in this case, Earth.

Its weak atmosphere and lack of water cannot support life as we know it.

The Moon has no moons.
