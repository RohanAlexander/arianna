dragon age has been one of my biggest inspirations and influences to get into fantasy art. without it, i would honestly think i would be doing something else. if i remember correctly the first character i painted digitally (never posted btw) was my warden from DAand my sketch for my art school entry exam was of hawke. i invested HOURS into the two games and totally got immersed in the lore. so i really owe bioware onemorrigan is probably my favorite character of the bunch because of the constant banter with allistair and the fact she's sarcastic all the timeuntil now i've been meaning to do some dragon age art but never really got around to it till now so here it ishope you like it! and sorry for the SEVERE lack of updates
