Simple and Easy Vegan Waffles

|Serves 3-4|

Ingredients

1 cup whole wheat flour

1 Tbsp ground flaxseed

2 tsp baking powder

1 Tbsp sugar (turbinado, coconut sugar, or maple syrup)

pinch of salt

1 Tbsp oil

1 cup almond milk

Instructions

Preheat waffle iron to your desired setting (we like ours more crispy). In a large bowl, combine dry ingredients (flour, flaxseed, baking powder, sugar, salt). In a small bowl, whisk together wet ingredients (oil, almond milk). Pour wet ingredients in dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Do not over stir! Pour batter onto waffle iron (I use about 1/4 - 1/3 cup) and cook until golden brown. Enjoy!

Notes

*I always double this recipe and freeze any leftovers to use for quick breakfasts when I'm in a hurry.

*This recipe is designed for traditional waffle irons, not Belgian waffle irons.
