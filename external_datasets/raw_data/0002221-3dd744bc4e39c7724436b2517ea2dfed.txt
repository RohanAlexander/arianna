As expected, Nokia has officially announced the Lumia 920. The leaks of this device have been spot on. The 920 has a Snapdragon S4 dual-core processor, a PureView camera on the back, and wireless charging. We’ll have more details as they are revealed.

The PureView camera is very special. It reacts to the movements of your hand, and lets the shutter stay open longer. They haven’t said exactly how many mega-pixel the camera is, but the leaks said 8 and they have been correct so far.

The display is called “PureMotion HD Plus.” It has a fast refresh rate to reduce blur when scrolling. The ClearBlack display is even better now, and the color tones adjust to glare from the sunlight. The display can “even bee seen in the dessert.”

The battery on the Lumia 920 is 2,000mAh. Combined with the efficient processor, this makes for a long lasting display. The wireless charging comes with a Fatboy pillow, a plush charger that can be set comfortably on your bed. Nokia has also announced wireless charging partnerships with Virgin Atlantic and The Coffee Bean.
