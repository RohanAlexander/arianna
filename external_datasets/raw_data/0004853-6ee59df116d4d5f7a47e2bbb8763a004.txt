It has a registered depth of 155km and is classified as “weak” in intensity by GeoNet.

After posting the quake on their Facebook page, GeoNet immediately received numerous comments from people who felt the quake in Gisborne, Taradale, Opotiki and Dannevirke.

On Monday at 4.22am there was a 3.3 magnitude quake at a depth of 7km, located 15km north west of the volcano.

A resumed pattern of minor activity saw White Island’s alert level raised by GNS Science on Friday, with the aviation colour code changed from green to yellow. The alert level is 1, meaning there are signs of volcanic unrest.

It followed an increase in volcanic tremor levels Thursday night and images of activity on the volcano cameras.

The island resumed activity in July 2012, leading to explosive eruptions and ash emissions in August. A small lava extrusion occurred in November, followed by phreatic, steam driven activity in December which continued through January and February 2013.

Very minor ash emissions have been interspersed throughout this eruption sequence as conditions within the craters have changed.
