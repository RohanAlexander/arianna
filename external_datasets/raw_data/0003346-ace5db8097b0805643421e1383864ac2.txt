New Kids on the Block is an animated television series featuring the adventures of the New Kids on the Block. The series lasted a season from 1990 on ABC. Beginning the following year, it aired in reruns from October 12, 1991[1] to 1993 on The Disney Channel.[2][3]

Though the group appeared in live action clips, their voices were done by other voice actors, due to licensing reasons.[citation needed] "You Got It (The Right Stuff)" was the opening theme, while an instrumental version of "Step by Step" was the closing theme.

Plot [ edit ]

The series focuses on the group's misadventures along with their managers, who are based on their real-life one Maurice Starr.
