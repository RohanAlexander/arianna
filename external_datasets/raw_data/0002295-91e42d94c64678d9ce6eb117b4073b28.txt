They say breast is best when it comes to nurturing a baby.

That message doesn’t translate well when it comes to baked goods.

An unnamed mother has stirred up outrage on Facebook after she made brownies with breast milk for a school bake sale.

A post on the Sanctimommy Facebook page revealed the mother’s dilemma when she ran out of cow’s milk as an ingredient for her baking and decided to use her own breast milk as a substitution.

“I didn’t have time to run to the store and didn’t think it was a big deal (some of those kids could use the nutrition let’s be honest),” the mother wrote. “And it wasn’t even that much.”

The mysterious mommy stated another parent found out about the secret ingredient and was “blowing it way out of proportion.” The woman foolishly turned to the Internet for suggestions.

Let’s just say the reaction to the post – which has garnered 921 shares and more than 1,000 comments on Facebook – has been mixed and emotional.

“Honestly this is actually a damn near criminal offense,” one outraged commenter stated. “Breast milk, like blood or semen, can carry diseases, which is why legit donation services screen the milk before passing it along to moms and their babies.”

“Secretly feeding children that aren’t yours baked goods with your bodily fluids in them is gross, shady and borderline psychotic,” another angry commenter wrote.

While most of the comments were hateful, some people were confused over the situation.

“But…milk isn’t even one of the ingredients for brownies…human or cow,” wrote a confused commenter.

Others found humour in the situation.

“But was it homogenize?” joked one person.

“‘Susan. These brownies are DELISH! What’s in them? …me,’” another humourously chimed.

While breast milk is good for babies, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes that HIV and other serious infectious diseases can be transmitted through the liquid.
