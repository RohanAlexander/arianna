The CLS will make its debut at the Los Angeles Auto Show.

Mercedes-Benz has released a second teaser image to preview the third-generation CLS. The next evolution of the original four-door coupe will make its official debut in a few short weeks during the annual Los Angeles Auto Show.

The latest teaser image sheds insight into what the model looks like inside. We see a wide color touch screen nearly identical to the one found in the S-Class, and Mercedes' Energizing Comfort technology with five modes including "joy" and "vitality."

Although dark, the first teaser suggests the CLS takes Mercedes' design language into a sharper, sportier direction. The front end wears angular headlights that are better proportioned than the ones on the outgoing car and a wide, GT-like grille. We'll have to be patient to find out what the rest of it looks like.

The new CLS shares its MRA platform with the current E-Class, according to British magazine Autocar, yet it borrows its engines and tech features from the bigger S-Class. We expect a 48-volt electrical system will come standard on most -- if not all -- variants sold in the United States. Buyers in Europe will have access to four- and six-cylinder turbodiesel engines, but don't expect to see those cross the pond.

Mercedes-AMG will make its own version of the CLS with roughly 600 horsepower. It will slot beneath the Porsche Panamera-fighting sedan the sub-division is developing as a four-door alternative to the GT.
