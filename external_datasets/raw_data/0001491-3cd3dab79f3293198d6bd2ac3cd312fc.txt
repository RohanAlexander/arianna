Kuno Wittmer will take part in the new Pirelli World Challenge SprintX Series, with the Canadian driver having been confirmed at Mills Racing.

He’ll join team owner/driver Michael Mills at the wheel of the team’s BMW Z4 GT3 in the three-round championship, which kicks off at Canadian Tire Motorsport Park next month.

“I am really looking forward to the inaugural SprintX race at Canadian Tire Motorsport Park.” Wittmer said.

“Racing in my home country is always as nice thing, especially in front of family, friends, and representing the BMW brand.”

Wittmer, a BMW of North America factory driver, is a former IMSA GT Le Mans class champion, and will bring a wealth of experience to the upstart team, which made its debut at Circuit of The Americas last month.

The Texas-based team, with the support BMW of North America, has shifted its focus entirely to SprintX for the remainder of the year.

“I’m honored to have the opportunity to participate with Kuno for this new series,” Mills said.

“It’s a dream come true to be included in the BMW family, and we are excited to pursue a championship with Kuno and BMW behind us.”

BMW of North America Motorsports Manager Victor Leleu added: “Michael had a very successful weekend at COTA in the GTA class, showing great pace and quick adaptation to the BMW Z4 GT3.

“The car is fast and reliable, and Michael and Kuno will form a very strong and complementary pair.”

The inaugural SprintX weekend takes place at CTMP on May 20-22, with the championship also including stops at Utah Motorsports Campus and Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca.
