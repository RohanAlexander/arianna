Football Prize to reflect season rather than calendar year

Zidane, on the verge of being 'The Best'

FIFA want to change the format of 'The Best' award, as the organisation has discussed the possibility of changing the awards to recognise the best players from each season rather than the calendar year.

The Balon d'Or, meanwhile, will stay in its current format - the two awards will no longer be linked as The Best hopes to distance itself from the otherwise similar individual prize.

Only in South America does the football season fall in line with the calendar year, with football elsewhere running from August to June.

Ahead of this change to 'The Best', the timing of votes will be brought forward to the beginning of each season to allow for players and coaches to vote in each category with the previous season in mind.

The Champions League will therefore have an impact on the vote, with Cristano Ronaldo's decisive goals at the end of the season and Gianluigi Buffon's form in goal for Juventus likely to be a consideration for those who vote.

The timing of the final of the competition will also play favourably into both players' hands, with Real Madrid playing Juventus in Cardiff on June 3.

London has been chosen as the location for the awards this season and the gala will take place on October 23, at which the male and female players with the most votes will collect their awards alongside the World XI.
