RNC to run Obamacare ad during Daily Show

The Republican National Committee will be running an anti-Obamacare commercial during Tuesday's "The Daily Show with Jon Stewart" in the Washington, D.C. market, the RNC announced Tuesday morning.

The ad that will run Tuesday is part of a series of four videos created by the RNC playing on the famous "Get a Mac" ad campaign run by Apple from 2006 to 2009. In the videos, a younger man plays the private sector, while an older, overweight and fumbling man plays the new healthcare law and the HealthCare.gov website.

"These videos help to convey the absurdity of ObamaCare and the administration’s careless behavior," RNC Chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement.

It's clear who the RNC is trying to target with the ad during the Daily Show - the exact population the new health care law is relying on to buy health insurance in order for the whole system to function. But, the ad is only running on "The Daily Show" in the Washington, D.C. market, one full of federal government workers and contractors, many of whom have health insurance through their jobs.
