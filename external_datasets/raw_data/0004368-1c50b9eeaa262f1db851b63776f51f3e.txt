The last time the Broncos won a Super Bowl, the victory may have been influenced at least some by the distraction that former Falcons safety Eugene Robinson provided the night before the game. Robinson has provide the next team the Broncos will face in the Super Bowl with a simple warning: Don’t do the dumb thing that I did.

Robinson, who works as an analyst on the radio broadcasts of Panthers games, was arrested the night before Super Bowl XXXIII for soliciting prostitution in Miami. He talked to the Panthers about the incident before the team left Charlotte for San Francisco.

“That’s the first time I heard that story. I didn’t know anything about it,” tight end Ed Dickson said, via Joseph Person of the Charlotte Observer. “It says a lot that he would open up and say something about it. Because a lot of people would hold it in and not even talk about that moment. . . . Him being an ex-player, him being in that moment, he wanted to make sure nobody else would be that guy again. That’s huge.”

Robinson declined to comment on the speech that he gave to the players, but it was smart for the Panthers to take advantage of the fact that they have a compelling in-house reminder of the pitfalls that can arise during Super Bowl week.
