A survey of the various pundits show that, yes indeed, President Obama won the second presidential debate against Mitt Romney. Funny how when real people are involved, Mitt Romney falls to pieces.

Charlie Spiering ‏@charliespiering My take: Obama did better in debate, caught Romney on several zingers

M. Ambinder ‏@ThePEOC I watched from the debate hall, didn’t see how it looked, don’t know what others are saying. My early impression: Obama killed it.

Ari Melber @AriMelber Probably the best debate of Obama’s career, a U-turn from first debate – @maddow

Joshua Green @JoshuaGreen Well, I thought it was near-rout for Obama. Curious what snap polls say.

AdamSerwer @AdamSerwer Yeah Obama won that debate.

Ethan Klapper @ethanklapper Race is reset, and Romney’s bounce is probably done after this. Especially among women.
