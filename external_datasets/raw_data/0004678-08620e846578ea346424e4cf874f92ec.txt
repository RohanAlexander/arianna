[Haskell-cafe] [ANNOUNCE] First Public Release of the Snap Framework

Hello all, To coincide with Hac Phi 2010 (http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Hac_%CF%86), the Snap team is happy to announce the first public release of the Snap Framework, a simple and fast Haskell web programming server and library for unix systems. For installation instructions, documentation, and more information, see our website at http://snapframework.com/. Snap is well-documented and has a test suite with a high level of code coverage, but it is early-stage software with still-evolving interfaces. Snap is therefore most likely to be of interest to early adopters and potential contributors. Snap is BSD-licensed and currently only runs on Unix platforms; it has been developed and tested on Linux and Mac OSX Snow Leopard. Snap Features: * A simple and clean monad for web programming, similar to happstack's but simpler. * A *fast* HTTP server library with an optional high-concurrency backend (using libev). * An XML-based templating system for generating xhtml that allows you to bind Haskell functionality to XML tags in your templates. * Some useful utilities for web handlers, including gzip compression and fileServe. * Iteratee-based I/O, allowing composable streaming in O(1) space without any of the unpredictable consequences of lazy I/O. If you have questions or comments, please contact us on our mailing list (http://mailman-mail5.webfaction.com/listinfo/snap) or in the #snapframework channel on the freenode IRC network.
