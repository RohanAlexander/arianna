Batman writer Scott Snyder has wrapped up his "Night of the Owls" arc, and as soon as he's done with bringing back The Joker this Fall, he now looks set to reintroduce The Riddler to the DC Universe in "The New 52" continuity.

I will use Riddler in 2013 RT @ AlabamaMike2814 : @ Ssnyder1835 are you agreeing Riddler is awesome or that you're writing a Riddler story?

Yes. RT @ BradWiegele : @ Ssnyder1835 Will you please give us a badass Riddler story? He's so cool in Arkham city but nowhere in the DCU.
