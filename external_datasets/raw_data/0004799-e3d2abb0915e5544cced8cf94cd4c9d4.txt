About the trainer

After focusing on programming and writing in more recent years, I am now once more conducting frequent training courses on Linux/UNIX system programming and a number of related low-level programming topics that are of particular relevance for developers of low-level user-space applications in domains ranging from embedded to enterprise server systems. The emphasis of my courses is on providing deep conceptual understanding coupled with intensive in-class practical work.

I work closely with my customers, providing personalized assessment of their training needs, and where necessary customizing my courses to those needs. My customers range from small and medium-sized businesses to multinational companies and governments. Past customers include Google, IBM, BMW, Axis Communications, Cisco Systems, Hewlett-Packard, Container Solutions, and the French and British governments. (References from past and current customers are available upon request.)

I have a unique set of qualifications and experience that ensure course participants receive training of a very high standard:

I have been programming on UNIX systems since 1987 and teaching UNIX system programming courses since 1989 .

. I'm the author of The Linux Programming Interface widely acclaimed as the definitive work on Linux system programming.

widely acclaimed as the definitive work on Linux system programming. I am actively involved in Linux developmentâ€”working with kernel developers on testing, review, and design of new Linux kernel-user-space APIs.

Since 2004, I have been the maintainer of the Linux man-pages project the manual pages documenting the Linux kernel-user-space and GNU C library APIs. As well as being the project maintainer, I have also written or cowritten around 40% of the 1000+ manual pages provided by the project.
