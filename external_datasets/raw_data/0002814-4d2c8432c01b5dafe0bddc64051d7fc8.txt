Garry Monk took over Middlesbrough after parting ways with Leeds United

New Middlesbrough manager Garry Monk has announced a new five-man backroom team.

Ex-England striker James Beattie and former Swansea City coach David Adams have been hired as first-team coaches while Darryl Flahavan has been named goalkeeping coach, having worked alongside Monk at Leeds United last season.

In addition, Sean Rush joins the club as head of physical performance, while Ryan Needs comes in as head of performance analysis.

All five new members of the coaching staff have previously worked with Monk at Swansea City and Leeds United.

"It's important as a manager that you build staff around you to work with you to deliver what is needed to be delivered," said Monk.

"We have great experience together as a group - we've worked together for a good period - and they have a good understanding of what I expect and how we work together.

"As you go through your career, you're consistently looking to refine and improve things and we're all on that journey together.

"The guys have the skill sets that we need to be able to cover all bases and there's also the importance of being able to rely on them with the responsibilities they will have."
