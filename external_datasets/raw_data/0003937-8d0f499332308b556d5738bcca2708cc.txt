I originally wanted to recreate the final fight between the Barbatos and Graze Ein from the anime for my first diarama. Didn’t feel like buying the 6th form HG Barbatos but I had the HG Barbatos that came with the Long Distance Booster. Looked into how much model buildings cost (they are expensive) and didn’t want to scratch build them so I went with a forest fight. From there I came up with a concept that had the Graze Ein win the fight by drill kick and thought I would try using a motor to to have it drilling.

Started off with a 16″ x 10″ wood base and used cork board to build up the cliff sides. That was a bad idea since the layers are so thin and cork is not that easy to cut. I’ll definitely go with Styrofoam next time. Added a large sheet of cork to put on the base so i can lift the terrain part and run wires through the base. Forgot to take pics of the final cork cliff layout.

Used plaster cloth to cover the ground and cliff areas. Once that dried, I added rock plaster castings and hid the edges with more plaster cloth. I used the Outcropping, surface and boulder rock molds from woodland scenics.

Once that layer dried I added more plaster to the ground to remove some of the flatness. I used the kits to leave inpressions in the plaster to make my life easier later on.

The Painting

I used woodland scenics leopard spotting technique (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SfP4RpcDYw) to paint the rocks. Used burnt umber, slate and black for the colors.

Used earth undercoat to paint the rest of the base. This took several layer to get the look I wanted.

The Plants

I masked off the areas that i wanted to keep as dirt and started adding layers of Woodland scenics fine and course turf (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQBDf6vQ_v8)

Removed masking tape and checked the kits to make sure they still fit in the exposed areas.

Once the base layer of grass was down, I added bushes, vines and trees.
