The “record-breaking” figure is the most Clinton has raised over a 72-hour period since she became the nominee at the Democratic National Convention in July, according to the campaign. The sum only includes online fundraising.

The surge in contributions came after FBI Director James Comey sent a letter to Congress on Friday informing them that his agency discovered the existence of emails that appear to be “pertinent” to its investigation into the private email server Clinton used while secretary of State.

It was later revealed that the emails were found on a computer belonging to former Rep. (D-N.Y.) Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of longtime Clinton aide Huma Abedin who is under investigation for allegedly exchanging sexually explicit messages with a minor.

Comey’s letter was widely criticized by Democrats for being vague, and Clinton's surrogates have assailed Comey for not being more forthcoming.
