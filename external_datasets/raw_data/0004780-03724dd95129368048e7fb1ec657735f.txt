The £225,000 building is being built in an area where an average house is sold for around £625,000. The tree house is one of three projects the architects designed for private clients looking to settle in the mountains of Almaty. It was commissioned by a 38-year-old businessman who wanted a home for a two people and a place that would allow for his spiritual and creative development. Most of all, the house is designed to provide a space where one can escape stressful everyday life in the city.

The house is to be built using metal columns, plasterboard panels, concrete and wooden flooring, and floor-to-ceiling windows. It takes the concept of the tree house to the extreme by fully enveloping a living tree. The home’s staircases wind around the tree it as it were the central pillar of a tower. Scheduled for completion in 2014, the daylit house provides its inhabitant with his own private piece of the forest.
