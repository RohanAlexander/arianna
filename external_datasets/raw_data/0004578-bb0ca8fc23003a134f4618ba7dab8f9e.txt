Tottenham are continuing to monitor Real Madrid midfielder Isco after showing an interest in him in the summer.

Isco has made only two starts for Madrid this season and said this week he would consider his future if coach Zinedine Zidane continues to ignore him.

Spurs are believed to have enquired about the Spaniard in the closing days of the transfer window but neither party made a decisive move.

Yet Standard Sport understands Isco is still admired by Spurs head coach Mauricio Pochettino, even though he has a number of attacking midfielders.

Isco’s contract expires in the summer of 2018, meaning he could leave Madrid for nothing in less than two years. If Isco’s situation has not improved by January, clubs are likely to attempt to persuade Madrid to release him. The most probable deal at that stage would be a loan, with an obligation to buy. It is more realistic, however, that Isco would move at the end of the season, when Spurs are expected to be one of his suitors.

Meanwhile, AZ Alkmaar technical director Max Huiberts has backed Vincent Janssen to succeed at Spurs.

Janssen moved to north London from AZ last summer but has yet to score in the League.

Huiberts said: “I’m sure he’ll adapt quickly to the Premier League. People said it was ridiculous we wanted more than £8million for him but he was the top scorer in the Dutch league last season.”
