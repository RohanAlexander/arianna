NEW ORLEANS -- After more than four decades in business, Tony Angello’s will close it's doors forever Saturday, December 24. Angela Angello Riviere, daughter of the restaurant’s late chef and namesake, confirmed the decision.

Tony Angello’s is a family-run Creole-Italian restaurant known for their "Feed me" menu and signature dishes including the lobster cup, Eggplant Tina and Angello's versions of pasta bordelaise, osso bucco, stuffed shrimp, cannelloni, veal or eggplant Parmigiana and any number of other "red gravy" favorites.

Last summer, Tony Angello, owner of the beloved Lakeview restaurant that bore his name and was famous for home-cooked versions of Creole-Italian specialties, died at the age of 88.

The restaurant opened at the corner of Fleur de Lis Drive and Harrison Avenue in Lakeview in 1972, after Angello and his brother ran another establishment, the Black Orchid, for several years in Gentilly.

The Lakeview place looked more like a home than a restaurant, and that feeling was matched in the food and atmosphere, as well as in the physical appearance.

Tony Angello’s is located at 6262 Fleur De Lis Drive and is open for dinner Tuesday through Saturday.
