JERSEY CITY -- Three teens were arrested today in the Journal Square section of Jersey City by Hudson County sheriff's officers on their way to the county courthouse on Newark Avenue, authorities said.

The sheriff's officers had dropped a prisoner off at the Hudson County jail in Kearny and turned onto Pavonia Avenue when they saw 75 to 100 teens "in a scuffle" outside the McLaughlin Funeral Home at about 3:30 p.m., Hudson County Sheriff's Office spokesman Mike Makarski said.

A 16-year-old boy and a 17-year-old boy who were fighting were arrested and charged with civil assault and obstruction of justice, Markarski said.

A third boy, 16, fled from sheriff's officers and he was charged with obstruction of justice. All three were to be released to their parent or legal guardian.

An 18-year old victim sustained a minor injury to his left ear during the scuffle. He received medical attention from EMTs at the scene and he was released.
