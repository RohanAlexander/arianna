The Limited Edition Desco Figure You Can Only Get With A Disgaea 4 Append Disc

Nippon Ichi is continuing the story of Disgaea 4: A Promise Unforgotten with a downloadable scenario starring Fuka and Desco. Just like Raspberyl’s side story from Disgaea 3, the Fuka and Desco storyline has four chapters, will be sold as downloadable content on PSN, and as an append disc at stores.

The retail version of the Fuka & Desco chapters requires a copy of Disgaea 4. Fans still might want to give the append disc a look because it comes with bonus items. A soundtrack CD and a Desco figure are part of the package. Let’s take a look at that.

The Disgaea 4 append disc will retail for 4,179 yen ($53) and it can only be purchased if you pre-order it by July 24. The scenario alone will cost 2,000 yen ($25) as a digital download. The append disc, downloadable scenario, and a new version of Disgaea 4 with the Fuka & Desco episode built in will be available in Japan on October 27.
