Disappointing in Spain's defeat to Chile, Diego Costa re-affirmed he is Chelsea bound.

Diego Costa was one of the success stories of the La Liga season, but his World Cup is already a major disappointment.

He came into the tournament as a player to watch, but also one with concern hanging over him.

That was due to the injuries which hampered the end of his season, and forced him off early into the Champions League Final.

In Spain's 5-1 loss to Holland and 2-0 defeat to Chile, Costa did not look sharp, and was entirely underwhelming.

His Â£32 million transfer to Chelsea still appears to be on however, although yet officially unconfirmed.

Spanish newspaper El Confidencial report Diego Costa was approached after the match in the mixed zone, and quizzed about his future, and if he was heading for Chelsea.

He responded: "My future is more there than at Atletico".

It's possible the ongoing transfer speculation has been a distraction for the striker, who has also had to contend with playing in the country of his birth Brazil, to represent Spain.

Costa added: "It has been a very good year in many ways, but also very hard on others."

The paper report that Costa's transfer could be made official within days, and importantly the striker has suffered no injury setbacks at least.

His World Cup disappointment will give him a point to prove upon arrival in the Premier League, and that may just work in Chelsea's favour.
