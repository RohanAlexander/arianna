In Part 2 of episode 25, join your hosts Rob Galluzzo, Ryan Turek, Elric Kane and Rebekah McKendry as they welcome on special guests Chela Johnson and Garo Setian from Lionsgate! Chela is the Vice President of marketing in Home Entertainment and the one that helped make this Vestron line a reality! And Garo is an in-house editor for Lionsgate and has been the man behind hundreds of trailers, TV spots and promotional videos, including the new trailers for the Vestron Blu-Ray releases.



We delve into their history with horror and Lionsgate. Discuss the first 6 titles in the Vestron Blu-Ray library, which consist of CHOPPING MALL, BLOOD DINER, WAXWORK 1 and 2, RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD 3 and CHUD II: BUD THE CHUD. Not only do we learn about how this line came to be, but we make suggestions for titles we'd personally like to see.



Then we talk about the importance of horror movie trailers! This includes the most successful ones, our favorite teasers and much, much more. Kick back, relax and enjoy!
