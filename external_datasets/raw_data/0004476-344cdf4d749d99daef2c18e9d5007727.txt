A new study has uncovered all kinds of interesting tidbits about the sex habits of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton supporters.

The annual study, conducted by top dating website company “Match,” found that Trump supporters are 11 times more likely to to expect sex on the first dates, while Hillary supporters are more likely to lie about their total number of sex partners. Trump supporters are also more likely to film themselves having sex.

The Singles in America study analyzed 5,504 singles ages over the age of 18. From the study:

Hillary supporters are more likely to: lie about the number of past sex partners (102%); “wait for the right person” (38%); actively look for commitment (43%) and want children (65%). On the first date they expect no physical contact (2133%), are 70% more likely to discuss politics and 226% more likely to discuss marriage.

Trump supporters are more likely to: film themselves having sex (99%); have five or more exes (54%); be unemployed (82%) or retired (96%); expect sex on the first date (1104%) and discuss their exes (116%).

According to the study, a third of women would not ask for a second date with Donald Trump. Older women said Sen. Marco Rubio was the candidate they’d most like to kiss, but millennial women said Sen. Bernie Sanders would be their first choice for a kiss.

The study also found that if you wanted a second date with a Republican, taking them to a fancy restaurant would make you 122 percent more likely to get that second date. Oddly, ordering sushi will make you 124 percent more likely to get a second date with a Democrat.
