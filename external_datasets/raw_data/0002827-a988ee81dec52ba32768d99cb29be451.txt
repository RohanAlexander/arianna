Each week Bob and Ivey take a trip Beyond the Wall to discuss HBO's 'Game of Thrones' from the perspective of fans of the books. If you've not read the books, tread lightly, as there are spoilers everywhere, sweet summer child. This week, we make several bold predictions about what will happen in season two.

Well, sports fans, it all comes down to this. Sunday marks the highly anticipated premiere for the second season Game of Thrones. For the past several weeks, Bob and I have been previewing the upcoming season, which will follow George R. R. Martin’s A Clash of Kings. We’ve looked back at the first season, talked about the casting of the new roles, previewed our most anticipated moments and discussed areas where we expected the series to deviate from the source material.

This week, we have several bold predictions for what we believe the second season might bring. As usual, a spoiler alert is in effect, as we will obviously be discussing events in Clash, and might look ahead to events beyond the second book.

Ivey:

Let me kick things off; in the first season, Peter Dinklage had a breakout performance as Tyrion Lannister. Fans of the book have almost universally been fans of the Imp of Casterly Rock, but I believe Dinklage’s performance endeared him to television viewers even more (to the tune of an Emmy win for Supporting Actor). This season, I expect Davos Seaworth will be the breakout character. The first time I read through A Song of Ice and Fire, I never really connected with the Onion Knight. I expect things to be different on screen.

Bob:

Hmm. You could be right. I always liked Davos. There’s something about a rough around the edges ex-pirate, but I’m not sure he’s going to be the story. My money is on Brienne. She’s the ultimate underdog up against so much hardship and yet she always struggles on. Add to that the fact that she is a bit of a badass and I think she’s going to be the one folks are talking about around the water cooler.

Ivey:

Perhaps; I’m just not sure Brienne will have enough story this season for that to happen. If we’re talking about seasons three and four, then I think she (and her companion on that journey) will have to be the favorites.

Bob:

We’ll have to see.

I think one thing that is going to disappoint fans is Dany’s story this year. If the show follows the book, there just isn’t a lot for Dany to do. She had a lot of story in season one. Yes, there’s going to be a fantastic scene in the House of the Undying, but her story doesn’t really pick up again until book three. Perhaps the writers will prove me wrong, but Dany kicking around Qarth with her little baby dragons is going to be a little dull, methinks.

Ivey:

I couldn’t agree with you more — though I’d extend that prediction beyond just this season, but that is a conversation for another column. Though, as we’ve discussed, I am really looking forward to the House of the Undying.

While Dany’s story might be lacking in the novel, Melisandre’s is decidedly not. I know you’re really looking forward to her boat trip with Davos, however I have a feeling that Melisandre will be far less interesting in the series than she is on the written page. Sometimes the mystery is lost when you pull a certain scene or character out of one’s imagination and puts it on the screen. Such will be the case with the red priestess.

Bob:

It’s entirely possible. From the look of the character, it appears that she is going to be a little toned down. I’m expecting a character that is more mysterious and less intimidating and sinister. In the book, with the struggle between Davos and Melisandre, she came across as wicked and powerful. My guess is that for most of the season (until she starts summoning up some shadows), she will be more of a quiet mystery. Whether that means she’s less interesting or not … I’m not sure.

I think one character that is going to get more interesting this season is Robb. He wasn’t even a POV character in A Clash of Kings so most of his story was told through the yes of others. I think that with the story of his and Jeyne’s romance at the forefront, along with his leadership as King of the North, he’s going to come out of this season with more fans than he had in the book.

Ivey:

I think so, too. I’m not sure Robb was ever as well loved by ASOIF fans as his father was, but I think that is something that has changed on-screen. The decisions Robb makes this season, specifically regarding Jeyne, obviously have major effects down the road. I’m glad we’ll get a chance to see that play out, instead of only hearing about it after the fact.

Another character I think fans will appreciate less this year is Bran. Let’s face it, brave-faced as he might have been last season, he was still a bit of a whiney brat (though less so than the lion’s share of his siblings). If it hadn’t been for the tragedy he experienced in the series premiere, I’m not sure fans would have tolerated him at all. Considering the changes he experiences this season – or at least become more obvious – aren’t something I think fans will be expecting, I’m not sure how much they’ll like it. At least, that was my reaction as a reader. What do you think?

Bob:

I’m not really sure. I could see it going either way. I think that because of the situation, he’s going to be forced to grow up a little and be less of a whiner. Bran’s story has always struck me as one of the very long arcs in the books and it’s going to be interesting to see that translate to the screen. I think that we probably won’t see a whole lot of the young Stark this year and when we do it will be concentrated on the three-eyed crow plot, which I have always found interesting. People like giant wolves, dude.

Ivey:

Well, I’ve seen some of the second season, and I have to admit I didn’t hate how they conceptualized Bran’s … dreams.

We did get a little more negative than I’d expected; any last minute words of positivity?

Bob:

It’s still one of the best shows on TV. This is all nitpicking, my friend. I can’t wait for the new season to start!

Ivey:

Indeed … nitpicking is often about as useful as nipples on a breastplate, but it can be fun.

We’ll see you back here next week as we discuss episode one, “The North Remembers.”
