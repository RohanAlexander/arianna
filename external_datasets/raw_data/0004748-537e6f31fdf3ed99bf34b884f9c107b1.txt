Reliving Wild 2015 4OT Auburn Win

How wild was it Oct. 24, 2015 at Donald W. Reynolds Razorback Stadium?

Here’s what happened

Behind an electric crowd of 72,008 and a clutch performance by senior quarterback Brandon Allen, Arkansas downed Auburn 54-46 in four overtimes.

Overtime

Auburn struck first with a touchdown in the first overtime period, putting the Tigers up by seven. Fast forward a few plays and the Razorbacks were facing a 4th-and-3 from the 6-yard line when Allen connected with Drew Morgan through a tight window across the middle. PAT good, tie game.

Double Overtime

The Razorbacks kept possession of the ball in 2OT and took just three plays to punch it in. From three yards out Kody Walker ran it up the gut to put the Hogs back on top.

Triple Overtime

Here’s where things got really interesting. After back-to-back Auburn touchdowns on consecutive possessions in 2OT and 3OT, Arkansas had its back against the wall again, trailing by eight points. After Allen hit Morgan on a short pass down to the 4-yard line the Hogs faced a 4th-and-2 from the 4. Offensive Coordinator Dan Enos continued his hot streak of dialing up just the right play at the right time. Counter flip to the left and Walker walks into the end zone. Touchdown. Not tied yet.

Needing a 2-point conversion to tie the game, Allen rolled out right —rolled some more, hesitated, kept rolling– before rifling it to Jeremy Sprinkle near the front pylon in the end zone.

TIE GAME.

Fourth Overtime

On the first play of the fourth overtime, Allen connected with Morgan for a 25-yard go-ahead touchdown pass that would be the game winner.

On the Tigers’ next possession, the Razorback defense shut down the run on first down and forced three straight incomplete passes to close out the contest.
