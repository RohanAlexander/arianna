CORAL GABLES, Fla. – The University of Miami men's basketball team will play nine nationally-televised games and host six conference foes that played in last season's NCAA Tournament, the Atlantic Coast Conference announced with its 2017-18 league schedule release Thursday.



The Hurricanes will make two appearances on ESPN's "Big Monday," hosting Duke and traveling to Notre Dame, and will make six other appearances on ESPN or ESPN2, including a road tilt at defending national champion North Carolina. The Hurricanes will also be showcased nationally on CBS when they host Syracuse.



"Year in and year out, the ACC is the best basketball conference in the country from top to bottom and this year will be no exception," Hurricanes head coach Jim Larrañaga said. "This schedule will provide a tough test every night, and we will need to play our best because nearly every game we will be squaring off against nationally-ranked opponents."



The ACC sent a league-record nine teams to the NCAA Tournament last season, including Miami, which has made the tournament in three of the last five years. Miami posted a 7-2 home record in conference games last season.



"Our fans created an electric atmosphere at Watsco Center last year and we are looking forward to having that same type of home court advantage this year," Larrañaga said.



Miami will host the Blue Devils on Monday, Jan. 15, at 7 p.m. The Hurricanes defeated Duke at Watsco Center on Senior Day last season, 55-50, behind 25 points from then-freshman guard Bruce Brown. The Hurricanes will venture to South Bend for their second "Big Monday" appearance on Feb. 19.



Miami hosts four conference games – Louisville, Wake Forest, Virginia and Virginia Tech – on either ESPN or ESPN2. The Hurricanes travel to Chapel Hill to face the Tar Heels on Tuesday, Feb. 27 on ESPN. Miami defeated North Carolina, 77-62, last season, UNC's largest margin of defeat in 2016-17.



The Hurricanes will also host Syracuse on Feb. 17, in a nationally televised CBS encounter. The Orange defeated Miami, 70-55, at the Carrier Dome last season before the Hurricanes exacted revenge in the quarterfinals of the ACC Tournament with a 62-57 victory.



The Hurricanes open their conference slate with two games on the road – at Pittsburgh (Dec. 30) and Georgia Tech (Jan. 3) -- before returning home to Watsco Center to host rival Florida State on Sunday night, Jan. 7, 2018, on ESPNU at 6 p.m. Miami then travels to Clemson on January 13, for another ESPNU telecast.



After hosting Duke, the Hurricanes travel to Raleigh, N.C., for a second consecutive season to face NC State for a regional telecast on Jan. 21. Miami swept the Wolfpack last season, opening ACC play with an 81-63 win in Coral Gables and then rallying for 84-79 victory at PNC Arena.



The Hurricanes return home to battle Louisville on Jan. 24, at 7:30 p.m. on ESPN2. Miami then faces the Seminoles a second time for a regional telecast in Tallahassee, Fla., on Jan. 27.

Pittsburgh visits Watsco Center on the final day of January before the Hurricanes head to Blacksburg, Va., on Feb. 3, to face the Hokies. That 2 p.m. tipoff will be televised on either ESPN or ESPN2.



The Hurricanes welcome Wake Forest to Coral Gables for an ESPN2 telecast on Feb. 7, followed by a road trip to Boston College on Feb. 10. The Hurricanes then return home to face Virginia on Feb. 13 for a 9 p.m. tip on ESPN2 before hosting the Orange four days later.



Miami has a quick turnaround for its "Big Monday" encounter in South Bend on Feb. 19. The Hurricanes host Boston College on Feb. 24, for a regional telecast prior to their trip to Chapel Hill for a 9 p.m. tip on Feb. 27. Miami wraps up ACC play at Watsco Center on Mar. 3, against Virginia Tech at noon. That game will be telecast on either ESPN or ESPN2.



The ACC Tournament will be held at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, N.Y., for the second consecutive year. The 2018 tournament starts on Tuesday, Mar. 6, culminating with the championship game on Saturday, Mar. 10.



In addition to their nine ACC games, the Hurricanes host five non-conference games at Watsco Center, starting with Gardner-Webb on Friday, Nov. 10. After back-to-back season ticket sellouts in 2015-16 and 2016-17, the demand for Hurricanes basketball season tickets is at an all-time high.



"We have sold out our season tickets for the last two season and we anticipate that this will be the third year in a row that you will not be able to buy a ticket once our season begins in November," Larrañaga said. "We encourage all of our season ticket holders to be sure they sign up now -- don't wait, because there won't be any available soon."

A limited amount of season tickets are still available to purchase beginning at only $150. Call 1-800-GO-CANES.
