Here’s the latest big thing everyone is talking about: Kathy Miller, who is the Donald Trump campaign’s chairwoman in the oh-so-crucial Mahoning County of Ohio, had harsh words to say about about President Barack Obama in a video that was posted to the Guardian‘s site today. That isn’t surprising, but her claim that he basically invented racism was.

To review, here’s some of what she said in her interview:

I don’t think there was any racism until Obama got elected. We never had problems like this … If you’re black and you haven’t been successful in the last 50 years, it’s your own fault. You’ve had every opportunity, it was given to you. You’ve had the same schools everybody else went to. You had benefits to go to college that white kids didn’t have. You had all the advantages and didn’t take advantage of it. It’s not our fault, certainly.

You can imagine why there was a major outcry.

Miller has now resigned. Here is the statement from the Ohio Trump campaign:
