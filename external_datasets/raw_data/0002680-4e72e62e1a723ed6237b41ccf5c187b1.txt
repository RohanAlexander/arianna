Susan Collins dismisses Palin presidential bid

By Rachel Weiner

On Tuesday, Rep. Spencer Bachus (R-Ala.) made headlines for saying Sarah Palin cost Republicans the Senate. (Some analysis of that claim here.) Now Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) is throwing cold water on the idea of a Palin 2012 run. She told the Kennebec Journal:

"I think she likes being a celebrity commentator for Fox and a speaker and being able to provide for her family," Collins said. "I think that life appeals to her. It's a lot easier to charge people up than to actually govern."

Collins also argues that moderates like herself will still have power in the new Congress. She says that as soon as he won, Senator-elect Mark Kirk (R-Illinois) called her up to say, "I can't wait to join your Mod Squad."
