One of the suspect vehicles was described as being a white Mazda 3.

Police are searching for several suspects wanted in connection with a robbery at a Mira Mesa home in early July.

The robbery happened on July 1 at a home in the 7000 block of Embry Point near Bacadi Drive, according to the San Diego Police Department (SDPD).

That evening, approximately 80 to 100 people were at the victim's home prior to the incident, attending a party. Some of those people were invited guests, and others were not, officials said.

Police responded to the home that evening, giving the host a first response notice.

Shortly after, the victim asked guests to leave his party.

That's when a group of four to six strangers showed up and attempted to get inside the victim's home, police said. When the victim tried to stop them, the confrontation turned into a physical altercation.

The victim was beaten inside his home, police said. The suspects stole his wallet and phone and took off in two separate vehicles.

One of the suspected vehicles is believed to be a white Mazda 3 driven by a woman. That car slammed into a parked car on Embry Way before driving off, police said.

The suspects are described to be in their 20s, but police do not have a more detailed description.

Anyone with information is asked to call San Diego Crime Stoppers at (888)580-8477. A $1,000 reward is being offered for any information leading to an arrest.
