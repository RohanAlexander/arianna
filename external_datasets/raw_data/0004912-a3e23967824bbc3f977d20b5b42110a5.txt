Suspended Oregon strength coach Irele Oderinde will be reinstated Sunday, an Oregon spokesman told CBS Sports Friday.

Oderinde was suspended for a month without pay on Jan. 17 after three players were hospitalized following what were characterized as strenuous workouts. The parent of one of the Ducks said her son had been diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis.

So-called “rhabdo” is commonly caused from overexertion. Muscle tissue breaks down, leaks into the bloodstream and can cause kidney failure.

At the time of the suspension, new coach Willie Taggart offered his “sincere apologies” in a statement released by the school.

Oderinde -- who came to Oregon with Taggart from South Florida -- will resume his normal duties according to the spokesman. The original suspension was for a month, but the exact date of his reinstatement wasn’t immediately clear.

Former football strength coach Jimmy Radcliffe had taken over Oderinde’s duties during the suspension.

It was previously announced that Oderinde will begin reporting to Andrew Murray, Oregon’s director of performance and sports science. He has previously reported to Taggart.

Taggart visited the three players while they were hospitalized. “As the head football coach, I hold myself responsible for all of our football-related activities and the safety of our students must come first” he said in a statement.
