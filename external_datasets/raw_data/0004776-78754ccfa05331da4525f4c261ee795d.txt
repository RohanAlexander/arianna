Donald Trump's golf paradise is threatened by a right Scottish bastard.

Protesters opposed to Donald Trump's planned $1.5 billion Scottish golf resort say they've pulled a trick shot out of their bag.

At the center of the plan is local fisherman Michael Forbes, who has long been an irritant to Trump. Forbes has refused the American tycoon's offer of nearly $700,000 (488,000 pounds) to buy his family's 23-acre run-down farm, which sits at the center of the planned resort.

But Forbes has sold an acre of his land near Aberdeen to protesters who also disagree with Trump's plans â€“ a sale which will force the property tycoon to face down more than 60 people.

The group, Tripping Up Trump, says it purchased the land and named it "The Bunker," after the sand trap that many golfers end up in.

"We've called this piece of the land the bunker because he will now find it impossible to force a sale as there will be so many names on it," group spokesman Martin Glegg said Wednesday. "This is the prime slot that Trump wants and there is no way he can get it now."

Glegg said he hoped eventually to have hundreds of names on the deeds.
