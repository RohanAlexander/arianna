“Get him! Get him! Get him!”

Vineland, NJ — Early this morning, yet another video has emerged showing the heinous murder of Phillip White by Vineland Police.

As we reported last week, 32-year-old Phillip White died in police custody last Tuesday morning after being beaten by police and viciously mauled by a K-9.

The video released on Facebook shows more clearly that White was limp and unresponsive when officers yelled at the K-9 to “Get him!” One cop continued to inflict blows to White’s body as the dog mauled his face, chest and arms.

The cops roll the unconscious man onto his back, then scream at him to roll back over, the entire time letting the K-9 continue to maul White, who was, again, completely unresponsive.

At no point in the video does Phillip White show any sign of consciousness, let alone resisting arrest.

As the video progresses, White’s arm can be seen being shaken about as the dog tears into him, completely limp. The man capturing the video is pleading for the officers to stop their attack, screaming that he is unconscious.

“He’s knocked out!” screams the onlooker. But sadly, this was to no avail.

It is even less surprising now, with the emergence of this new video, that Vineland police attempted to confiscate the damning footage. Fortunately, they were not successful.

Residents in the area have identified one of the officers to arrive on the scene as Dion Colvin. Although Colvin did not participate, he stood by and watched Phillip White get brutally assaulted and ultimately killed. Members of the community are urging Officer Colvin to speak out against this heinous crime.
