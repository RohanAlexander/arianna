Hours before the rock band Coheed and Cambria was scheduled to perform at the Comcast Center in Mansfield yesterday, police arrested bass player Michael Todd and charged him with robbing a nearby pharmacy of painkillers.

The Attleboro Police Department said in a prepared statement that officers responded to a Walgreens Pharmacy about 1 p.m. Sunday after Todd, 30, of Anaheim, Calif., allegedly demanded Oxycontin and threatened pharmacists with a fake bomb.

He absconded with six bottles of pain pills, police said.

“The male suspect fled behind the building,’’ the statement said.

“He was seen by a passerby getting into a taxi cab.’’

Police said they contacted a local cab company, which reported picking up a fare near the Walgreens minutes after the robbery.

The cab service told police the taxi was headed to the Comcast Center, where Coheed and Cambria were slated to open for the 1990s rock band Soundgarden last evening.

Attleborough police said they noticed the Mansfield Police Department, which sent officers to intercept the cab.

Todd was arrested at the concert hall and he will face charges of armed robbery and possession of a controlled substance, the statement said.

Todd was jailed in Attleboro on $10,000 cash bail while his bandmates performed without him.

New York-based Coheed and Cambria said in a statement on its website that it will not cancel any shows and plans to continue a tour of the Northeast and Canada with another bass player.

“Todd was arrested today on what we consider very serious charges and therefore he will not be finishing up the current tour,’’ the band wrote on its site.

“We are surprised, to say the least, and will address the situation with Michael after the tour.’’
