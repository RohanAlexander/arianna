THE definition of ‘sexy news’ has been taken to a whole new level after a Swedish TV station accidentally broadcast porn in the background of a news show.

Station TV4 was broadcasting a discussion segment on Russia’s involvement in the Syrian crisis when viewers noticed the erotic material on a screen behind the host.

Viewer Daniel Ek told Swedish paper The Local: “At first I realised I was looking at a naked woman and it quickly became clear she was having sex. It didn't take long before I realised it was a porn film.

"The image wasn't exactly in focus, but it wasn't hard to figure out what was going on”, he continued.

He offered his own theories as to how the mix up happened: “I had two theories. One is that someone was pissed off after getting fired and put the porno up as act of revenge. My other thought was that someone had simply screwed up.”

The channel stated the incident was caused by a mix up in the feed – as the station’s parent company also operate adult channels.

News editor Andreas Haglind said: “It's not like we were directly broadcasting porn. Put simply, it's crap that it happened. We're going to do everything we can so that it doesn't happen again.”
