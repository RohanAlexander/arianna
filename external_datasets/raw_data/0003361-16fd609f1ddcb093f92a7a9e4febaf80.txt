Fujisaki's 23-volume manga originally ran in Weekly Shonen Jump from 1996-2000. The manga is roughly based on the ancient Chinese novel Fengshen Yanyi . The fantasy manga and the first anime adaptation takes place thousands of years ago. An evil sorceress has bewitched the emperor of a powerful dynasty and he has become a mindless puppet. The country is in shambles and evil spirits lurk everywhere. The Confederation of the Immortal Masters plan a bold mission: they send a young master wizard to hunt down the villains and evil warlocks in the devastated lands.

Viz Media released the original manga in English between 2007-2011.

The manga inspired a 26-episode television anime series in 1999. ADV Films released the anime on DVD in 2001-2004 under the title Soul Hunter . Discotek Media later released the anime under the same name on DVD in June 2016.
