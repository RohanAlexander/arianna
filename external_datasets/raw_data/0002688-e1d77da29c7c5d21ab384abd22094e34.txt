Skip Holtz has scored his second big win against his alma mater in less than a calendar year.

The South Florida coach will add former Notre Dame defensive end Aaron Lynch to the Bulls' roster in 2012, the school announced Monday.

"With Aaron originally being from Florida, we're very familiar with the kind of player he is," Holtz said in a news release. "Aaron had a great freshman season at Notre Dame and we're excited to welcome him into the Bulls family."

The Irish announced April 13 that Lynch would transfer at the end of the spring semester. Lynch, a Cape Coral, Fla., native, earned freshman All-American honors in 2011, recording team bests of 5.5 sacks and 14 quarterback hurries, in addition to 33 tackles, seven tackles for loss and a forced fumble. He played in 12 games and started six.

Barring a waiver from the NCAA to play immediately, Lynch will have to sit out the 2012 season.

Lynch's first college game was the Sept. 3 opener against USF, which upset the Irish, 23-20, in South Bend, Ind.

With former Notre Dame and current New York Giants defensive end Justin Tuck in town over the weekend to serve as an honorary captain for the Irish's spring game, Lynch's mother, Alice, posted a message to Tuck on Twitter asking him to talk Lynch into staying at Notre Dame. It proved to be too little, too late, as the 6-foot-6, 270-pound Lynch is heading home to Florida.

Holtz, the Bulls' coach, is the son of ESPN analyst and former Notre Dame coach Lou Holtz.
