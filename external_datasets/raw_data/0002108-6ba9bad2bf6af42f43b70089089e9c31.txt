A male cheerleader almost cost his side victory in a recent game between Pittsburgh and Louisville after he rushed onto the court to celebrate a dramatic late slam dunk only to commit a technical foul.

Apparently convinced Kyle Kuric’s dunk had sealed victory for Louisville, the cheerleader rushed onto the court and hurled the ball in the air in celebration.

The referees were less than impressed with his actions though and with five tenths of a second remaining on the clock awarded Pittsburgh two free throws for a technical foul for delaying play.

Ashton Gibbs proceeded to sink the two throws but missed with a half-court shot that would have tied the contest and sent it into overtime. Instead, Louisville edged the game 62-59.

Commenting on the almost catastrophic intervention by the cheerleader, Louisville coach Rick Pitino joked: ‘The male cheerleader is coming to an end. It was good while it lasted. It was fun. Now we’ll try another sport for him.’

He added: ‘No, I’m sure it was unintentional, but you could actually lose a game that way. Hopefully he’ll learn the rules of basketball next time.’
