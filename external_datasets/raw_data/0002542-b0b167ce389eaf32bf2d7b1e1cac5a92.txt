With the release of the Defense Build Update, players have been creating labyrinths and going up against some very well designed ones. Since the release on April 29 through to the end of the day on May 2, there were 600 raids. The boss won 50.2% of the time and lost 49.8% if the time. Pretty much 50/50!

Additionally, there have been no reported crashes, and only 1 reported hang due to cards getting stuck in a state we didn't anticipate. If you have seen problems, please report them.
