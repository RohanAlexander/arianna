1. All matches are 20 overs per side, with the teams divided into three groups - North (Derbyshire, Durham, Lancashire, Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire, Yorkshire), Midlands/West/Wales (Glamorgan, Gloucestershire, Northamptonshire, Somerset, Warwickshire, Worcestershire), and South (Essex, Hampshire, Kent, Middlesex, Surrey, Sussex).

2. Matches start at 5.30pm (although there might be some changes to fit in with television schedules), with a 15-minute interval before the start of the second innings at 7.00pm.

3. Each innings should last no longer than 75 minutes.

4. Teams will incur a six-run penalty if they fail to bowl the full 20 overs within the 75 minutes.

5. New batsmen must be in position within 90 seconds of a wicket falling.

6. Only two fielders are allowed outside an inner circle during the first six overs of a team's innings.

7. Bowlers are permitted a maximum of a fifth of the total overs in a completed innings (ie four overs if there is no delay or interruption caused by rain).
