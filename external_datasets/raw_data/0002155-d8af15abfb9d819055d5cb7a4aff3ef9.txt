A new, 2015 Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet has leaked ahead of the stylus-packing device’s official unveiling.

Although Samsung has yet to shed any formal light on the existence of such a device, the 2015 Note 10.1 has popped up on the company’s official website.

Spotted by the folks over at TechTastic, the Galaxy Note 10.1 (2015) has been prematurely referenced in a services and app descriptions page. It was listed as one of a number of devices compatible with a range of Samsung services.

Name teasing aside, the leak has offered up no further insight into the capabilities of the 2015 Galaxy Note 10.1.

The timing, however, could be particularly telling. With the 2014 Galaxy Note 10.1 having been unveiled last October, annual refresh patterns would suggest that the 2015 Galaxy Note 10.1 could be with us in the very near future.

With the tablet’s name having leaked, new Galaxy Note 10.1 rumours have started to surface. One such report has suggested the device could be held off until November so as to hit retailers running Android 5.0 Lollipop direct from the box.

Last year’s Note 10.1 packed a 2560 x 1600 pixel display alongside a Snapdragon 800 processor and Samsung’s S-Pen stylus.

With the Galaxy Note 4 smartphone having recently jumped to a QHD panel, Snapdragon 805 chipset and a stylus with twice the sensitivity of its predecessors, we would expect any new Note tablets to follow suit.
