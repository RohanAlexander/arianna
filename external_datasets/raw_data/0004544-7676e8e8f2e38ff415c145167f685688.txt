Earlier today, former MMA fighter Jarrod Wyatt pled guilty to first degree murder and mayhem for one of the more grotesquely violent crimes in recent memory; in 2010, Wyatt cut an 18-inch hole in his friend and sparring partner Taylor Powell's chest before ripping out Powell's heart, tongue and face, all while tripping on mushrooms. As part of his plea Wyatt will serve at least 50 years in prison.

Fifty years does sound like a pretty good deal considering the barbaric nature of the crime, the scene of which is somehow more horrific than you'd imagine:

When police arrived that day at a home at the mouth of the Klamath River, they found Wyatt naked and covered in blood. He told the officers, "I killed him," and said he had cut out Powell's heart and tongue, according to court documents. The officers found Powell's body on the couch of the Requa home. His chest was cut open, and his heart, tongue and the skin of his face were gone, court records said. His heart was found charred in a wood-burning stove. An autopsy determined the organs had been removed while Powell was still alive, the documents said.

There's a lesson here, one from which we can all learn, and it is: under no circumstances should you ever take mushrooms with someone whose job is to maul people into submission while trapped in a steel cage.
