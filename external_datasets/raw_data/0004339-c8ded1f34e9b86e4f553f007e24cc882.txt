Explore the Unexplored: Lakes, rivers, and oceans are still alive when the sun goes down. Reveal wildlife, plant-life, and otherwise hidden treasures in the dark and you'll soon discover a whole new world under the water. Safely navigate your route above water with the paddle's super-bright LEDs. A Torch Paddle illuminates your surroundings wherever you end up.

Intuitive: We’ve designed our paddles to be user-friendly and ergonomic so that you’re comfortable with it from the moment you pick it up.

Durable: Our paddles are built strong so that the LED lighting system is protected from all that Mother Nature has to throw at it. Fiber-reinforced nylon, carbon fiber, and an integrated design ensures that nothing will stop these paddles from doing their job.

LEDs are built straight into the paddle inside the channels for protection.

LIGHT UP YOUR NIGHT WITH TORCH PADDLES!

A little bit about Moab: Everyone has a second home and Moab happens to be ours. From jeeping to rock climbing to canyoneering and endless other activities, we've found our adult playground. Corona Arch is our swing set and just like our paddles, we've improved the design over the years so that its a flawless experience and not to mention very safe. We made a video a few years ago that shows what we like to do. (click the link) This is what some of our donors can have a chance of doing.
