Israeili artist Ronit Baranga (born in 1973) uses clay and porcelain to craft some really disturbing tableware that would probably instantly make you lose your appetite.

Already known for her strange sculptures, Baranga applied her creepy creativity to the kitchen, putting realistic mouths and fingers on dishes and cups.

“I would like that anyone who sees my work feels something – what they feel is not relevant to me, as long as they feel. I hope that the emerging feelings will cause the viewers to think about the ideas behind my work… The combination of ceramic cups with ceramic fingers represent an idea in which the still creates a will of its own, enabling a cup to decide whether to stay or leave the situation it is in,” [1] says the artist.
