Mississippi State just found a way to hit her better than most teams have this season, and that's why we changed it up with Delanie (Gourley) at the end of today's game."On Florida's offense…"If you would have asked me who would've have had the biggest hits today, I would have said it would be (Aubree) Munro and (Kirsti) Merritt. Both of them have hit Alexis Silkwood pretty well historically. They both hit it out of the ball park last year a couple of times, so I think there was a right on left match-up there that's favorable to them. Both Aubree and Kirsti had really nice swings in the third inning. I thought we were patient enough at the plate earlier to get into that situation where we weren't chasing pitches."This series concludes tomorrow at 5 p.m. on SEC Network and it can be heard on Florida Sports Talk (WGGG-AM & WMOP-AM/FM).
