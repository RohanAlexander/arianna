New Colt City, once known as San Franciscolt, was once a thriving city with a perpetual pulse rivaling that of even Manehattan. However, as the war went on and the water rose, the entire city was swallowed by the ocean until all that remained was the battered remains of the financial district. The final flicker of life was stomped out when the bombs hit and the city's skeleton was bathed in toxic residue-or so they thought.Many years later, life again emerged, but under a new banner- The New Colt City. A mysterious leader is said to be in control of this city, but only the most powerful of the citizens know of its true form.However great the city may be, some ponies will always seek adventure. Shortly after repairing a nearby boat, Firefly and Tinkerer journey off to a fabled city untouched by the bombs and filled with the attractions of the pre war era.I don't know, but I think this is one of my only happy fallout images.EDIT: I made this picture to be in the 1111th drawfriend, and when I saw it as the header, I was happy. I believe it's also the first of my images to make it to the header.
