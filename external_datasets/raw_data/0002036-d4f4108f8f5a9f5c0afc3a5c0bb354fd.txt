Sometimes it happens on rough days that a glimmer peaks through.

I received a handwritten letter via snail mail (address on sidebar) from a young Jesuit… I know, I know….

Here is some of it:

Thank you for your vocation, your bold witness to the truth and beauty of the Church’s teaching, and your blog. I’ve been in [JESUIT SCHOOL] for my theological studies for the past three years and found your blog encouraging and grounding to say the least. Please pray for me and the twelve other men being ordained with me. For the greater part we are a solid JPII/Benedict group and I have a lot of hope for the good things we might do to do right by our Founder’s great vision.

That’s what I’m talking about!

There are a lot of younger Jesuits who want the real deal. They need support.

Papa Ganganelli! Pray for them!

Dear readers, pray for them.
