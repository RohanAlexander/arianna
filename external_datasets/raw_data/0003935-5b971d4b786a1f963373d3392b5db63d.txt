Many of us have assumed that the relative media silence over the ongoing genocide of pygmies in Africa is due to a desire to avoid, whenever possible, depicting black Africans in a negative light. While there is definitely some truth to this, there might be another, more sinister, motivation behind this neglect.

The leftist establishment assumes, as a matter of faith, that race is not a meaningful biological concept. That racial differences are superficial. Mathilda writes (in a comment):

The pro-race ones aren’t as noisy though, as people like you automatically have a hissy if someone observes one of the many racial non-cosmetic differences between human poopulations. Such as…

http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2007-09-03-dna-differences_N.htm We are 99% the same as each other (revised by Venter recently). Not the 99.9% the same you see touted about so often.

This is a fair amount of differences, as we are 98.4% the same as a chimp, so a small amount of DNA can make a lot of difference. Contrary to what is commonly reported in thn Media, we are not ‘unusually closely related’ to each other compared to other mammals. We are fairly average.

BTW, the 4% variation in human only DNA that defines us as races… in other species the same amount can easily define a new species, let alone a sub species. Read up on Chichlid fishes.
