Fargo Police are investigating what they believe is a credit card skimming operation. They have been receiving reports of people's credit or debit card information being used, while still having cards in their possession.

Deputy Chief Joe Anderson says they believe the skimming operation is travelling through the area and may go back as far as January 2016.

Fargo Police officers and detectives are investigating numerous incidents, which have resulted in multiple active cases. They say there may be multiple suspects involved.

The department wants to remind people there are numerous ways criminals can obtain your credit card information.

“It may be as simple as criminals finding your credit card statement in your mail or garbage, leaving your credit card unattended, hacking internet sites where you make purchases, or using a scanner to capture your credit card information.”

Police say to monitor your credit and debit card activity and report unauthorized charges to your card provider.

Anyone with information regarding the individuals involved should notify the Fargo Police Department at 241-5777.
