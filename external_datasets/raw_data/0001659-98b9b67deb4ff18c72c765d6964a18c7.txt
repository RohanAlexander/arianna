New Glasgow police have issued a warrant for the arrest of a 34-year-old man after an incident where an officer was dragged several feet behind a car.

Around 4:20 a.m. on Sunday New Glasgow police saw a man driving the wrong way along George Street in downtown New Glasgow. Two officers stopped the vehicle and approached it, suspecting the driver might be drunk.

The driver fled and one of the officers was dragged from the car for three to five feet.

EHS checked the officer at the scene and treated him for minor injuries.

"Luckily the officer wasn't hurt further," said Const. Ken MacDonald of the New Glasgow Regional Police.

Police pursued the suspect's vehicle but it evaded them in the Thorburn area.

Police have issued an arrest warrant for Barrett Johnson Fraser, 34, and are asking for help from the public. Police say Fraser is facing charges of flight from police officers, dangerous operation of a motor vehicle, two counts of assault on police, and two counts of assault with a weapon.
