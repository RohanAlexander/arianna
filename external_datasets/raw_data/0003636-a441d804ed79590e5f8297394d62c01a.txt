Here is some news:

I occasionally get asked if there is a way to get my comic in print, and after I discontinued the Lulu volume there wasn't. However, if you missed out before, there is no need to worry, as Gunnerkrigg Court is being published as a 300 page hardback book by Archaia Studio press.

Here is a little announcement about it on Newsarama.

Gunnerkrigg Court: Orientation will contain the first 14 chapters up until the end of the meeting with Coyote, will be in full colour, and is scheduled to come out in May. What's more, despite this version being more than twice the length of the old book, and printed professionally, it should be about the same price ($25). That's a lot of comic for your buck right there.

I'll post more news as I have it.
