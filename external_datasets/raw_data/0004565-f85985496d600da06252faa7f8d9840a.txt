Two suspects in their 20s were arrested at the Bell Centre. A 22-year-old man faces an assault charge and will remain in custody until he appears in court Monday. A 23-year-old man, facing a charge of armed assault, has been released on promise to appear at a later date.

Police were studying video footage of the incident Sunday afternoon to determine if other arrests would be made.

Camille Estephan, president of Eye of the Tiger Management, and Butler’s promoter, said he was disappointed by the events.

He called the incident “irresponsible and inexcusable.”
