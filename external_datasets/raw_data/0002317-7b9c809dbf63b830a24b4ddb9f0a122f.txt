Got a cool 2.4 million dollars sitting around and a love for 80’s movies? The home made famous by a crashing Ferarri and Cameron’s refusal to give into his father any more is currently on the market.

THE BEN ROSE HOME-site of the famous movie “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off”, cantilevered over the ravine, these two steel and glass buildings, which can never be duplicated, have incredible vistas of the surrounding woods. This is a unique property designed by A. James Speyer and David Haid, both notable architects of the 20th Century. Estate Sale Sold “As Is” No disclosures! This is an amazing architectural treasure.

As is? Does that include all of the movie memorabelia reportedly still in the home? It’s a 4 bedroom, 4 bath home with roughly 5300 square feet of living space. If I can get 2,400 to each contribute $1000 . . . well, I’ll be leaving the country. But wow, that would be a cool home to own.
