Action Bronson has released a new track called “Let Me Breathe,” from his new album Blue Chips 7000. The track was premiered on Zane Lowe's Beats 1 radio show today. Listen to it here and below. It was produced by Harry Fraud, who also executive produced the album. And listen to Bronson's new interview with Zane here. He calls his new music "U2 on steroids." Rick Ross also guests on the album. No release date has been set, but Bronson told Zane that he's hoping to release it by late July/early August.

Although he hadn’t released a ton of music in the recent past, Action Bronson has kept plenty busy. He’s got his Viceland shows, he’s appeared as a celebrity chef on talk shows, and he’s got a new matchmaking show coming to Snapchat. Last year he shared the new song “Durag vs. Headband.”
