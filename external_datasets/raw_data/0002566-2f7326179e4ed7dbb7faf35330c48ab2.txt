February 28, 2015, at UFC 184. That was the last time Cat Zingano competed in the UFC.

While she pleaded to get right back in there after her 14-second armbar loss to Ronda Rousey, the former title contender instead sat in the sidelines for a year and a half. During that time off, Zingano's weight ballooned up to 175 lbs, and she has slowly dropped the weight in preparation for her return at UFC 200.

Zingano took to Instagram to post a series of photos showing a timeline from January up to the present.

Her post came with the following caption: "Fighters be like.... I was 175 in January & 145 today. Reality vs expectation. There is a much bigger fight than what you see go on in that cage. And If I can do it, anyone of y'all can. #teamalphacat #ufc200 #bulkingJ/K #strongAF #regretnothing #alphacatzingano #sorrynotsorry #notashamed #thatbasstho #cake"

Zingano, 33, will face Julianna Pena as part of the UFC 200 preliminary card. She has a 2013 TKO victory over the current UFC champion, Miesha Tate.
