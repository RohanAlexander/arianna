NEW HARTFORD, N.Y. -- A man is accused of reaching for a gun just before getting in a fight with a Wal-Mart loss prevention officer in a parking lot in New Hartford.

Police said were called around 8 p.m. Tuesday to the Wal-Mart at 4765 Commercial Dr. after two men were confronted by employees for stealing.

Tevin V. Joyner, 20, was being detained by loss prevention officers while 26-year-old Willie Alexander fled across the parking lot and toward the store's garden center, police say.

Witnesses told police that Alexander was trying to get rid of the gun when a loss prevention officer approached him.

The two fought after Alexander allegedly reached for the gun on the ground while the employee was trying to detain him.

New Hartford Police Officer Ann Marie Brelinsky took Alexander into custody when she arrived at the parking lot.

Joyner and Alexander are charged with misdemeanor petit larceny, while Alexander also faces a felony second-degree criminal possession of a weapon charge.

Both men were sent to the the Oneida County jail. Alexander is in custody without bail and Joyner was released Wednesday by a court order, records show.
