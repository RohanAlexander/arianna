The problem with Xbox Kinect - aside from a decent range of top-drawer titles - is the inability to play without a large living room and yards of space.

Gaming accessories manufacturer Nyko seeks to change all that, though, with this badboy accessory.

The Nyko Zoom for Kinect reduces the space required to play Kinect by up to 40 per cent. By my calculations, that means the recommended distance required to stand away from the sensor can be lowered from 8ft to under five.

The Zoom clips on top of the sensor without any modification and effectively makes Kinect look the wrong way through a pair of binoculars.

It also comes bundled with iBoutique Zoom Lens Cleaner, a brush-like device of which the name is fairly self explanatory.

The Nyko Zoom will see its UK release on 31 August. Amazon is now taking pre-orders for £36. ®
