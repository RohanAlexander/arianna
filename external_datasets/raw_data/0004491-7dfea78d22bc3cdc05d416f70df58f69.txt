Think of the most neglected areas in Dayton, Springfield, Middletown or Hamilton and super-size it by 1,000 times or more.

The WSU men's basketball team passed a run down and worn out area to play at Detroit Mercy on Dec. 31, 2016.

That’s not a mocking indictment on this nation’s onetime industrial might. It’s more a nod to the evolution of a mighty city that couldn’t keep up with changing technology or overcome unchecked political corruption from within.

This video is a snippet of what pervades much of Detroit. It’s 6 Mile Road, also known as McNichols Avenue. Taking this exit off Interstate 75, this is the way to Detroit Mercy University, where Wright State played a men’s college basketball game on Saturday, Dec. 31, 2016.

The gated campus is about two miles from I-75. Scores of abandoned and burned-out homes line the way. This also is about 15 miles north of downtown Detroit, where much has been revitalized but the rest wastes away in disarray.
