Two weeks after the White Settlement City Council voted to kick a beloved cat out of the public library, city leaders have reversed course and will let Browser remain a live-in mascot.

The Fort Worth suburb's governing body voted 3-0 on Friday to let Browser stay, following backlash from their 2-1 decision in June to give the tabby 30 days to find a new home.

Browser, a former shelter cat, had been at the library nearly six years before council member Elzie Clements called for his removal.

Mayor Ron White has said Browser got caught in the political crossfire after a city employee wasn't allowed to take a puppy to work at City Hall.

But on Friday, White said he was overwhelmed by the number of people on social media who supported keeping Browser on the job.

"This is not just a cat, it's like a family pet," former council member Alan Price told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.



Like most felines, Browser spends a good deal of time napping, lounging and sneaking out the door â€” but he also attends the library's GED classes and has an honorary diploma, the library says. And each year, the library sells a calendar full of pictures of Browser as a fundraiser.
