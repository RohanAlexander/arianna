Hillary Clinton told NBC News' Lester Holt on Wednesday that she will not go insult-for-insult with Donald Trump in what has already been a nasty general election campaign.

"He can run a campaign of insults. I'm running a campaign of issues that are going to produce results for the American people," Clinton said in an interview airing on NBC Nightly News on Wednesday.

Clinton said Trump is "temperamentally unfit" to be president, while Trump has gone after Clinton for everything from her use of a private email server to controversies surrounding former President Bill Clinton's administration.

Clinton became the first presumptive female presidential nominee for a major party this week, though Democratic rival Bernie Sanders has vowed to fight to the convention next month. The former secretary of state, however, did not call on Sanders to end his campaign.

"When it doesn't work out I know that feeling, it is a hard one and it takes time to really work through it so we are reaching out through our campaign to his campaign," she told Holt.

Clinton secured a majority of pledged delegates during Tuesday's nominating contests -- eight years to the day when she ended her first presidential run.

"I am going to do everything I can to make it possible for him to be a good partner in our ongoing efforts to, you know, pursue these goals that I mentioned and to defeat Donald Trump," Clinton said.
