A weekend in the Sierra de Gredos is really rewarding. You can enjoy a few days in the countryside, with snow covered mountains as background and exploring this natural landscape and towns, full of history.

In this post you will discover, through my travel photography, some of the places that you should not miss on your journey through the Sierra of Gredos. There are many towns and places to explore, so I encourage you to leave a comment telling Mindful Travelâ€™s Community your favorite place at the countryside or at the mountains. I would love to hear your choices!
