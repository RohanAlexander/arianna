Kan Colle Kai first details, new trailer

The PS Vita Kantai Collection is actually happening.

Kantai Collection Kai is the final name for the the PS Vita adaption of popular browser game Kantai Collection, Kadokawa Games announced during the Kadokawa Games x From Software Fall 2014 Media Briefing.

Kadokawa Games’ Kensuke Tanaka will act as the game’s producer and director. It will use the browser game as its base, with a new user interface built for PS Vita including new systems like a “Waters Map.” Most of the Kanmusu (ship daughters) from the browser version will be included with the PS Vita version from the get-go, and gameplay will take a shift towards more overt strategy.

As previously announced, the game will launch in spring 2015.

Watch a new trailer below.

Thanks, Inside Games and Famitsu.
