A second car has become stuck on Gold Coast tram tracks, just hours after an unmarked police car on the way to a pedestrian fatality became wedged when it attempted a shortcut.

The driver of a white Toyota Corolla became stuck on the Sundale Bridge in Southport just before 2pm, halting light rail services between the Main Beach and Surfer's Paradise stops in both directions.

A Translink spokeswoman said buses were replacing trams between the two stops and commuters could expect delays of up to 40 minutes.

A Queensland Police spokesperson said the male driver was assisting police with their inquiries.
