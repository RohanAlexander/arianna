Mayoral candidate and City Councilwoman LaToya Cantrell has a lien on her house because the IRS says she owes about $27,500 in unpaid income taxes, The Lens reported on Friday (July 21). Cantrell told the investigative website that her mortgage lender, First NBC Bank, made a mistake that needs to be corrected.

The Lens reported the exact amount as $27,564.99 and said it was for federal taxes that weren't paid between 2010 and 2012 by Cantrell and her husband, attorney Jason Cantrell, including interest and penalties.

Mayoral candidate LaToya Cantrell says 'nothing stops a bullet like a job,' offers vision for tackling crime Candidate Desiree Charbonnet, meanwhile, released a written outline of her crime fighting plan.

Cantrell told the website that the mistake was part of a refinancing she and her husband undertook in 2013 to repair damage to the home dating to Hurricane Katrina. She said she had paid money into an escrow account that was supposed to settle the tax debt, but the bank never sent the money to the IRS.

During the last mayoral race, The Lens also discovered mayoral candidate Michael Bagneris also had unpaid taxes. The Lens said it hasn't found any court filings indicating Bagneris still owes those taxes.
