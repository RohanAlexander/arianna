Not Where US Predators in Pakistan Are (Updated)

Remember how outraged we were that Sen. Feinstein had leaked classified information that the US was using bases inside of Pakistan to control our Predator strikes against al Qaeda targets? It looks like Google Earth outed the CIA base of operations first. The above can be found using Google Earth's 2006 maps.

Secret is out. Time to find a new base. Thanks Google.

A thought: In all of the spy novels I read, the protagonists -- Scott Harvath, Mitch Rapp, Kirk McGarvey -- and even the antagonists -- al Qaeda -- all have a pretty good idea when satelites which might give away their positions are overhead. If novelists can think that far ahead, why can't the real CIA?



Thanks to Shachtman for the pic and who notes, correctly, that those are Predators and not Global Hawks.

UPDATE: Dave Schuler has some related thoughts.

Anonymous actually brings up a good point that Global Security had reported on the base some time ago. But I think the rather important thing here is not that the US has an FOB in Pakistan, but that many idiots in Pakistan are outraged that the base is being used by Predators. Case in point.

A lot of Pakistanis are under the impression that the US indiscriminately bombs poor innocents when we use our drones in their territory. I guess there's no fixing stupid.

Here's a great idea: why don't you morons control your own territory and get rid of al Qaeda and the Taliban? Either do that, or shut the hell up.
