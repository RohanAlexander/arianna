What do we know about the Democratic National Committee in 2017?

For starters it's completely in shambles.

Patriots to the right of the spectrum have complete and utter hatred towards the cultural marxist mantra of corruption in which the DNC wears upon their sleeves like a badge of honor.

Anarcho-Communists to the left of the spectrum have an undying flame of spite and anger towards the corrupt and failed platform of cheating and lies in which the DNC wears atop their heads proudly like a crown of thorns.

Everyone and their mother realizes that the DNC is a structural failure which has resulted in the collapse of one of the tallest skyscrapers in the land.

Democrats, those whom still remain; likely never supported Hillary Clinton to begin with.

She was one of the historically most corrupt candidates to ever receive a nomination by a major political party.

We're now understanding more about the corruption which helped crack the walls around the Democratic Party, since the compulsively horrendous liar known as Donna Brazile is now beginning to turn on her own.

In a new Thursday column, Interim Democratic National Committee Chair Donna Brazile trashed both failed President Barack Hussein Obama and corrupt Florida Representative Debbie Wasserman-Schultz for what she described as “handing complete control of the DNC to Hillary Clinton”, who never had a chance at winning due to her scandals.

While it's amusing to hear Donna Brazile completely slam the 44th President and DWS; both of which are correct interpretations of the type of corruption which brought down the Democratic Party; she's far from being a saint and actually helped lie and cheat for Hillary Clinton herself.

Let's go there first, before we follow up on Brazile’s column.

Remember that on October the 31st of 2016, right before the election, Democratic National Committee Interim Chair Donna Brazile was fired from her position as a political commentator at the fake news outlet CNN over email leaks suggested she had improperly supplied Hillary Clinton’s campaign with advanced knowledge of questions to be posed to her during Democratic campaign events hosted by the Communist News Network, CNN.

This prompted then CNN spokeswoman Lauren Pratapas <a href="https://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2016/10/cnn-severs-ties-with-donna-brazile-230534"> (as reported per Politico)</a> to release the following statement which said that on October 14th of 2016, the propaganda network CNN accepted Brazile’s resignation:

<blockquote>“On October 14th, CNN accepted Donna Brazile’s resignation as a CNN contributor. [Her deal had previously been suspended in July when she became the interim head of the DNC.] CNN never gave Brazile access to any questions, prep material, attendee list, background information or meetings in advance of a town hall or debate. We are completely uncomfortable with what we have learned about her interactions with the Clinton campaign while she was a CNN contributor.”</blockquote>

Now, we're all aware that Donna Brazile helped cheat for Hillary Clinton against Bernie Sanders (who actually was the voice of the people, whether or not you support him which I do not for obvious philosophical and ideological indifference); so let's discuss what Brazile had to say whilst throwing stones at a glass house.

Brazile says that during her position upgrade to interim chair, that she had began to find out that the DNC was in “serious financial peril”.

She then realized that due to those financial problems, Debbie Wasserman-Schultz’s former position of DNC Chair was forced to handover complete control of the DNC to the Clinton Campaign; which they did through subversion and behind a veil of secrecy.

The Clinton Campaign began filling the ranks with their own loyalists, to which gave her an unfair advantage against any and all opposition for the Presidential Nomination during the primaries.

To most of us, this is common knowledge. The Clinton family can be sat beside that of a Mafia crime family and you're likely not going to notice a difference in the pair; outside of a small elderly woman wearing a pantsuit in the front of the pack.

The DNC lap dog of Hillary Clinton, Debbie Wasserman Schultz is one of the targets of Brazile who tore into DWS with harsh rhetoric.

“Debbie was not a good manager. She hadn’t been very interested in controlling the party; she let Clinton’s headquarters in Brooklyn do as it desired so she didn’t have to inform the party officers how bad the situation was,” wrote Brazile in her opinion column on <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/11/02/clinton-brazile-hacks-2016-215774">Politico Magazine</a>.

Brazile unironically claimed that she believed from the get go that the DNC cheated for Hillary (this is hilarious considering Brazile was fired for the same thing), but claims she was working for Bernie to uncover the corruption now.

<blockquote>”Before I called Bernie Sanders, I lit a candle in my living room and put on some gospel music. I wanted to center myself for what I knew would be an emotional phone call.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>”I had promised Bernie when I took the helm of the Democratic National Committee after the convention that I would get to the bottom of whether Hillary Clinton’s team had rigged the nomination process, as a cache of emails stolen by Russian hackers and posted online had suggested. I’d had my suspicions from the moment I walked in the door of the DNC a month or so earlier, based on the leaked emails. But who knew if some of them might have been forged? I needed to have solid proof, and so did Bernie.”</blockquote>

I have to stop for a second and clean up the coffee I just spit out while reading the words of Donna Brazile here, who somehow writes that in her mind she took the moral high ground in order to defend impartiality and fairness.

Absolutely hilarious. Donna, you're a liar, a cheater, and even though I'm to the right if the fold as a strong supporter of President Trump; you helped screw Bernie and we all know it.

Bernie Sanders while never having a platform I would support with traditional Christian social values, and conservative principles on the economy, as well as an Isolationism per Nationalist foreign policy platform; I believe that in America any and every person running for office deserves a fair chance and the people must decide.

That never happened for Bernie. He had massive rallies, a strong grassroots campaign, and in his heart actually believed the Communist nonsense he was spewing.

While it's not favorable for me, the Democrats supported it and he was their Champion.

People like Donna Brazile, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the DNC, and every media outlet which worshipped Barack Hussein Obama helped cheat and lie to give Hillary Clinton an overwhelming advantage over Crazy Bernie.

Those are just the facts.

Brazile, of whom I have very little respect for however is telling some truths about the corruption; in saying now that the trail of Clinton Cash leads to, well… Obviously the Clintons.

Going further into explaining how Hillary Clinton was able to take over complete control of what should have been an impartial and unbiased DNC; Donna Brazile wrote:

<blockquote>”So I followed the money. My predecessor, Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, had not been the most active chair in fundraising at a time when President Barack Obama’s neglect had left the party in significant debt. As Hillary’s campaign gained momentum, she resolved the party’s debt and put it on a starvation diet. It had become dependent on her campaign for survival, for which she expected to wield control of its operations.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>”By September 7, the day I called Bernie, I had found my proof and it broke my heart. The Saturday morning after the convention in July, I called Gary Gensler, the chief financial officer of Hillary’s campaign. He wasted no words. He told me the Democratic Party was broke and $2 million in debt.”</blockquote>

I find this appalling to say the least, that Brazile is here lying suggesting the Democratic Party was somehow “broke”.

The Democratic Party not only has the support of billionaire globalists including Bill Gates and his ilk, <a href="https://thegoldwater.com/news/6469-Governor-McAuliffe-Refuses-to-Condemn-Antifa-on-Behalf-of-Haim-Saban">George Soros and Haim Saban (two people who are both Nazis and Communists, playing both sides)</a>, as well as those same billionaires’ supposed philanthropic organizations also using trickle down slush funds to finance violent activism such as Black Lives Matter and Antifa.

It's sort of the <i>“golem”</i> of the international Communists, those groups, which assist in controlling their hand picked puppets by applying pressures in order to ensure they can pull the strings once their candidate(s) take office.

According to Donna Brazile however, Barack Obama had crippled the Democratic Party financially, which I suppose is possible considering we now have some shred of evidence Obama was involved in some very subversive planning including his own movement which exists to turn the public against the current Trump Administration, in Organizing For Action (OFA).

<blockquote>”“What?” I screamed. “I am an officer of the party and they’ve been telling us everything is fine and they were raising money with no problems.””</blockquote>

<blockquote>”That wasn’t true, he said. Officials from Hillary’s campaign had taken a look at the DNC’s books. Obama left the party $24 million in debt—$15 million in bank debt and more than $8 million owed to vendors after the 2012 campaign—and had been paying that off very slowly. Obama’s campaign was not scheduled to pay it off until 2016. Hillary for America (the campaign) and the Hillary Victory Fund (its joint fundraising vehicle with the DNC) had taken care of 80 percent of the remaining debt in 2016, about $10 million, and had placed the party on an allowance.”</blockquote>

Brazile claims that Gary Gensler, who was the Chief Financial Officer of Hillary’s Campaign was fully aware of the DNC being “broke”, which is shocking considering not that they were allegedly broke, but that the Clinton Campaign was more aware of the financial disclosure of the DNC than even Brazile.

Stop and think about that for a moment, if you will.

The Clinton Campaign knew every penny the DNC had in its coffers.

There's absolutely no reason the Clinton Campaign should have known this if the DNC was impartial and a separate entity, considering Bernie was clobbering Hillary in the polls.

This means, without a shadow of a doubt, that the DNC was assisting and communicating with the Clinton Campaign.

Again most people knew this, including Democrats who have long since claimed that the DNC cheated for Hillary; but if they're to take this unscrupulous truth at face value from Brazile, they now have even more proof.

Brazile goes on to discuss her apparent shock in regards to this realization, whether or not the shock was fake is another debate.

<blockquote>”If I didn’t know about this, I assumed that none of the other officers knew about it, either. That was just Debbie’s way. In my experience she didn’t come to the officers of the DNC for advice and counsel. She seemed to make decisions on her own and let us know at the last minute what she had decided, as she had done when she told us about the hacking only minutes before the Washington Post broke the news. ”</blockquote>

What she's implying here only underscores that Debbie Wasserman-Schultz’s position wasn't answering to the people, or the DNC, but directly to the Clinton Campaign.

<blockquote>”On the phone Gary told me the DNC had needed a $2 million loan, which the campaign had arranged.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“No! That can’t be true!” I said. “The party cannot take out a loan without the unanimous agreement of all of the officers.””</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Gary, how did they do this without me knowing?” I asked. “I don’t know how Debbie relates to the officers,” Gary said. He described the party as fully under the control of Hillary’s campaign, which seemed to confirm the suspicions of the Bernie camp. The campaign had the DNC on life support, giving it money every month to meet its basic expenses, while the campaign was using the party as a fund-raising clearinghouse. Under FEC law, an individual can contribute a maximum of $2,700 directly to a presidential campaign. But the limits are much higher for contributions to state parties and a party’s national committee.”</blockquote>

So the DNC, and Donna Brazile; weren't even in control of the Party.

In fact this sort of means that the Democratic Party in itself is a fraud and the people don't have any say at all.

Democrats, your party is a front organization controlled by Globalists, who select the candidates, put them up on a podium after dressing them in makeup and forcing them to remember their scripted lines, and the Billionaire puppet masters pull the strings from the shadows.

Even Donna Brazile is now acknowledging this fact, in suggesting the DNC was being managed from outside forces to her dismay without her even being aware of the decision making process.

That epiphany of sorts is something Brazile goes on to expose, showing how the billionaires use individuals to finance their subversion and manipulate current laws around campaign contributions.

<blockquote>”Individuals who had maxed out their $2,700 contribution limit to the campaign could write an additional check for $353,400 to the Hillary Victory Fund—that figure represented $10,000 to each of the 32 states’ parties who were part of the Victory Fund agreement—$320,000—and $33,400 to the DNC. The money would be deposited in the State's first, and transferred to the DNC shortly after that. Money in the battleground states usually stayed in that state, but all the other states funneled that money directly to the DNC, which quickly transferred the money to Brooklyn.”</blockquote>

<h2>Do you understand what this means folks?</h2>

This is a crime of epic proportions, first and foremost. No I'm not talking about just Hillary Clinton here; I'm talking about the bankers and international Communists who organized this manipulation of the election laws.

I've always said this is happening, that the $2,700 max contribution limit is being manipulated.

How? It's simple. Let's go with a hypothetical in order to explain how it's done.

The billionaire puppet masters will take say, a million people, who each have a maximum of $2,700 they can contribute.

On behalf of those people (many who have donated ten, twenty, fifty bucks or what have you), the puppet master will max out their contributions without them even knowing.

If for example one million people gave $2,700 it would equal $2,700,000,000.

Now again those numbers are just an example, we have no idea what amounts were actually given (but the Department of Justice and the FBI cronies as well as the Federal Elections Commission should be investigating this).

This is how the elites, a handful of powerful individuals, control politicians and their platforms.

It's not a coincidence that President Donald Trump who literally self financed and took small amounts from Trump Supporters didn't have but a fraction of the money available for Hillary Clinton.

Donna Brazile, despite what you think of her clearly realized this was occurring to.

<blockquote>“Wait,” I said. “That victory fund was supposed to be for whoever was the nominee, and the state party races. You’re telling me that Hillary has been controlling it since before she got the nomination?”</blockquote>

<blockquote>”Gary said the campaign had to do it or the party would collapse.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“That was the deal that Robby struck with Debbie,” he explained, referring to campaign manager Robby Mook. “It was to sustain the DNC. We sent the party nearly $20 million from September until the convention, and more to prepare for the election.”</blockquote>

Hold up. <i>”That was the deal that Robby struck with Debbie”</i>?

Wew. There's an admission of collusion between Hillary Campaign Manager Robby Mook and the DNC as per Debbie Wasserman-Schultz’s betrayal of Democrats.

Again while this story is being ran by everyone, there are the points that aren't being realized (or maybe they are and they're avoiding the discussion) by the Mainstream Media.

This is when Donna Brazile goes on to suggest she (whom was supposed to be the Chair of the DNC) was literally asking someone from the Clinton Campaign for answers about their own available finances and expenses.

<blockquote>”“What’s the burn rate, Gary?” I asked. “How much money do we need every month to fund the party?”</blockquote>

<blockquote>”The burn rate was $3.5 million to $4 million a month, he said.</blockquote>

<blockquote>”I gasped. I had a pretty good sense of the DNC’s operations after having served as interim chair five years earlier. Back then the monthly expenses were half that. What had happened? The party chair usually shrinks the staff between presidential election campaigns, but Debbie had chosen not to do that. She had stuck lots of consultants on the DNC payroll, and Obama’s consultants were being financed by the DNC, too.”</blockquote>

Imagine if Bernie’s campaign had this sort of proof during the primaries that there was such control over the DNC from Hillary Clinton and her campaign cronies.

Even Brazile here, who obviously doesn't realize what she's saying, is admitting to discussing financial planning with one campaign (Hillary’s) and not another (Bernie’s) which implies Hillary was the chosen candidate and the primary in itself was a dog show to fool the masses.

What do we make of this, and what can be done about it?

Well first and foremost I'm not a Democrat, so it has little interest to me outside if believing this destroys the integrity of the United States of America and our elections.

It does exactly that, completely and utterly removing the sense that the people have a voice at all.

Even more so uninspiring is what Brazile said next regarding the “mess she had inherited”.

<blockquote>”When we hung up, I was livid. Not at Gary, but at this mess I had inherited. I knew that Debbie had outsourced a lot of the management of the party and had not been the greatest at fundraising. I would not be that kind of chair, even if I was only an interim chair. Did they think I would just be a surrogate for them, get on the road and rouse up the crowds? I was going to manage this party the best I could and try to make it better, even if Brooklyn did not like this. It would be weeks before I would fully understand the financial shenanigans that were keeping the party on life support.”</blockquote>

What exactly was the point of continuing the road campaign then during the primaries?

It was already decided by the <i>powers that be</i> that Hillary Clinton was the chosen candidate.

It clearly was all a fraud.

Brazile seemingly understands this, yet didn't expose it? She continues ranting as if she somehow was doing the right thing (which is preposterous).

<blockquote>”Right around the time of the convention, the leaked emails revealed Hillary’s campaign was grabbing money from the state parties for its own purposes, leaving the states with very little to support down-ballot races. A Politico story published on May 2nd, 2016 described the big fund-raising vehicle she had launched through the states the summer before, quoting a vow she had made to rebuild “the party from the ground up… when our state parties are strong, we win. That’s what will happen.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>”Yet the states kept less than half of 1 percent of the $82 million they had amassed from the extravagant fund-raisers Hillary’s campaign was holding, just as Gary had described to me when he and I talked in August. When the Politico story described this arrangement as “essentially… money laundering” for the Clinton campaign, Hillary’s people were outraged at being accused of doing something shady. Bernie’s people were angry for their own reasons, saying this was part of a calculated strategy to throw the nomination to Hillary.”</blockquote>

So Brazile was fully aware, that Hillary Clinton had not only seized power of the DNC but was burglarizing, literally stealing, money which belonged to individual States in order to benefit the Clinton Campaign?

Where the hell is the investigation into this?

We have Donna Brazile outright admitting knowledge of crimes committed by the Clinton Campaign.

Of course, Brazile doesn't realize what she just admitted and she goes on to suggest that she was somehow surprised by these facts.

<blockquote>”I wanted to believe Hillary, who made campaign finance reform part of her platform, but I had made this pledge to Bernie and did not want to disappoint him. I kept asking the party lawyers and the DNC staff to show me the agreements that the party had made for sharing the money they raised, but there was a lot of shuffling of feet and looking the other way.”</blockquote>

So wait Donna, you didn't <i>want to disappoint Bernie</i>, yet you had evidence of cheating and were even complicit in it since you were aware Robby Mook had made a deal with the Clinton Campaign as per Debbie Wasserman Schultz and you didn't go public with it?

No Donna, you're a traitor to the United States of America.

You were complicit fully in allowing any integrity in our elections to be thrown out the window.

Surprisingly Brazile goes on to imply even more damning evidence against the DNC and the Clinton Campaign.

<blockquote>”When I got back from a vacation in Martha’s Vineyard, I at last found the document that described it all: the Joint Fund-Raising Agreement between the DNC, the Hillary Victory Fund, and Hillary for America.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>”The agreement—signed by Amy Dacey, the former CEO of the DNC, and Robby Mook with a copy to Marc Elias—specified that in exchange for raising money and investing in the DNC, Hillary would control the party’s finances, strategy, and all the money raised. Her campaign had the right of refusal of who would be the party communications director, and it would make final decisions on all the other staff. The DNC also was required to consult with the campaign about all other staffing, budgeting, data, analytics, and mailings.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>”I had been wondering why it was that I couldn’t write a press release without passing it by Brooklyn. Well, here was the answer.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>”When the party chooses the nominee, the custom is that the candidate’s team starts to exercise more control over the party. If the party has an incumbent candidate, as was the case with Clinton in 1996 or Obama in 2012, this kind of arrangement is seamless because the party already is under the control of the president. When you have an open contest without an incumbent and competitive primaries, the party comes under the candidate’s control only after the nominee is certain. When I was manager of Al Gore’s campaign in 2000, we started inserting our people into the DNC in June. This victory fund agreement, however, had been signed in August 2015, just four months after Hillary announced her candidacy and nearly a year before she officially had the nomination.”</blockquote>

There it is, the smoking gun for Democrats.

An agreement for the “victory fund” was signed just four months after Hillary announced her candidacy and a year prior to her officially winning the nomination.

It was rigged from day one.

Funny though, Brazile implies she sought evidence of corruption after this.

<blockquote>”I had tried to search out any other evidence of internal corruption that would show that the DNC was rigging the system to throw the primary to Hillary, but I could not find any in party affairs or among the staff. I had gone department by department, investigating individual conduct for evidence of skewed decisions, and I was happy to see that I had found none. Then I found this agreement.”</blockquote>

I'm not sure if she's blind, deaf, or playing dumb here but she had evidence of internal corruption, from herself the moment she spoke with Gary Gensler, who was working for the Clinton Campaign, about the finances of the DNC.

That's collusion with intent to manipulate from that day forth in my opinion.

Thus rendering the rest of the primaries useless.

However Brazile states that there was nothing wrong with this agreement, but I bet Bernie supporters would disagree.

<blockquote>”The funding arrangement with HFA and the victory fund agreement was not illegal, but it sure looked unethical. If the fight had been fair, one campaign would not have control of the party before the voters had decided which one they wanted to lead. This was not a criminal act, but as I saw it, it compromised the party’s integrity.”</blockquote>

The Federal Election Commission should decide this Donna, not you who is clearly a suspect in any such investigation.

<blockquote>”I had to keep my promise to Bernie. I was in agony as I dialed him. Keeping this secret was against everything that I stood for, all that I valued as a woman and as a public servant.”</blockquote>

Knowingly misleading Bernie Sanders, she has just admitted. Wow. Just wow.

<blockquote>”“Hello, senator. I’ve completed my review of the DNC and I did find the cancer,” I said. “But I will not kill the patient.” ”</blockquote>

Donna, you were never a surgeon, or a doctor, but playing the role of a murder trial; as in you were the defense attorney, the prosecution, the jury, the Judge, and the executioner.

You kept the truth from the public and had the entire case in your hands, and decided to end it in the fashion you did which killed Bernie Sanders’ chances at a fair and balanced primary.

She goes on to suggest that she continued to keep the lie exactly that; a secret which benefited Hillary Clinton alone.

<blockquote>”I urged Bernie to work as hard as he could to bring his supporters into the fold with Hillary, and to campaign with all the heart and hope he could muster. He might find some of her positions too centrist, and her coziness with the financial elites distasteful, but he knew and I knew that the alternative was a person who would put the very future of the country in peril. I knew he heard me. I knew he agreed with me, but I never in my life had felt so tiny and powerless as I did making that call.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>”When I hung up the call to Bernie, I started to cry, not out of guilt, but out of anger. We would go forward. We had to.”</blockquote>

As we all historically now know, Brazile not only tried to cheat the system while working at CNN in favor of Hillary over Bernie, but robbed the American people of a clean primary season.

Your tears are fake, Donna Brazile, just like you, just like the Democratic Party, just like Barack Hussein Obama, and just like Hillary Clinton.

What are people supposed to make of these admissions from Donna Brazile today?

While we know she's <a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-in-new-book-donna-brazile-assails-1509656748-htmlstory.html">This goes to google</a> planning to release a new book, she has completely torn the lid off of the actions and corruption of the Democratic National Committee as well as forever tarnished the American election system by giving a damning statement about the rigging in favor of Hillary Clinton.

She's even made herself complicit multiple times, to which I demand (all Republicans and Democrats should unite here) an investigation into these actions.

Jeff Weaver, who served as Sanders’ campaign manager, said Thursday that Brazile’s book “confirms what many understood to be the case.”

“We saw throughout the campaign a pattern from the DNC that was favorable to Clinton. They wanted her to be the nominee,” he said.

Senator Bernie Sanders has yet to publicly speak on these matters but regardless of how you feel about Bernie Sanders; he was robbed and this warrants an investigation.

DNC spokesman Xochitl Hinojosa said, “The DNC must remain neutral in the Presidential Primary process, and there shouldn’t even be a perception that the DNC is interfering in that process.”

Good news Hinojosa, there's a new chair in Tom Perez now.

Bad news Hinojosa, there was zero neutrality in the Presidential Primaries.

The DNC cheated for Hillary Clinton.

Brazile saying that Barack Obama was responsible for the debt however, that warrants a separate investigation.

Why was Barack Obama, who had already served two terms; and needed zero dollars for any campaign involving himself at all, handling campaign cash to begin with?

What the hell was really going on there?

We know that <a href="https://thegoldwater.com/news/7016-Obama-and-Soros-Shadow-Government-Organizing-AntiFa-for-Phoenix-Trump-Rally">Organizing For Action, an Obama and Soros related group </a>has been used during the Trump Administration to assist AntiFa in their massive protests.

The Goldwater has also helped to expose the <a href="https://thegoldwater.com/news/3655-Indivisible-George-Soros-Newest-Coalition-Better-off-Invisible">George Soros and Barack Obama backed Project Indivisible</a>; so could they have stolen cash from the DNC or redirected it towards those causes?

We know now per Donna Brazile Hillary stole money from the State’s coffers.

Where did that money go?

Hillary lost, and that alleged missing money hurt other State and local candidates across the country for the Democrats (which I'm not complaining about their losses, I'm complaining about the apparent thefts).

Democrats should be outrage, which many who despised Hillary were and voted for Trump or a third party, but with this new evidence they have an actual case for taking action.

Let's see if Black Lives Matter or AntiFa hit the streets against the surfacing of this information.

Progressives, and actual Communists; well they never supported Hillary Clinton to begin with.

Those people wanted Bernie Sanders or even someone further left to shift America into a Socialist nightmare that in their minds would somehow be a wet dream of equality.

Unfortunately that's not how it actually works when you implement a social-welfare state built upon the grounds of Karl Marx’s philosophies and demented ideals.

<a href="Communism and Socialism have never, and will never work. ">https://thegoldwater.com/news/5524-Why-Communism-Socialism-Never-Works</a>

So what does the left wing of America have left?

Well, they should have a fair and balanced chance through Democracy to win.

We now know they do not have a fair chance, and if Democrats would like to demand an investigation; I staunchly support them to preserve the integrity of our elections.
