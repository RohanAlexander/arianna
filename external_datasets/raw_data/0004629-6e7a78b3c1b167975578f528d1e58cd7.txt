LONDON â€“ Maisie Williams (Game of Thrones) and newcomer Florence Pugh are starring alongside Monica Dolan, Greta Scacchi and Maxine Peake in British writer/director Carol Morley's The Falling.

Morley's script, billed as a dreamlike coming of age drama, details the story of a troubled girl at the center of a mysterious fainting epidemic, who is determined to discover the cause of the malady spreading through her British all-girl school in 1969, a year when the whole world seemed poised on the brink of change.

British sales, finance and production banner Independent Film Sales will rep the project to buyers at next month's American Film Market.

The Falling is presented by BBC Films and the British Film Institute in association with Lipsync Productions.
