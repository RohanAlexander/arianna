When asked if a conflict similar to the events inciting World War I could happen today, Indy Neidell responded, “There are an awful lot of similarities in the world today with the world of 1914.”

“Of course that kind of question is really impossible to answer,” he acknowledges, “but I wouldn’t at all rule it out.”

In an AMA (Ask Me Anything) discussion on Reddit, the historian host of The Great War YouTube series invited users to challenge his knowledge of the first World War, inquire about what he hasn’t covered in the show’s first 234 videos, and get his historical perspective on the United States’ current political climate.

While Neidell began his YouTube series in July 2014 on topics you’d expect to find in a standard WWI curriculum—the assassination of Franz Ferdinand, early trench warfare, propaganda, the Red Baron—the show has since branched out to give a much more comprehensive look at the “Great War,” detailing everything from soldiers’ diets and salaries to what’s wrong with EA’s Battlefield 1 trailer:

As the series nears its $10,000 Patreon goal to enable its crew to “start planing trips to the European theatres of World War 1 and tell their stories in a completely new way,” Neidell teased what history buffs can expect to see in upcoming episodes.

And for fans unable to help the crowdfunding effort, Neidell’s social media manager Flo joined him in his AMA to share this open invitation: “You can always help with research if you want.”
