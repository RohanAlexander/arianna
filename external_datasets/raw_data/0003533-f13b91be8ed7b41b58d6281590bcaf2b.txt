Vincent said the name of the chapter! XDLove, trust, and respect are going to be pretty common themes throughout this chapter. I mean, they're significant to the story as a whole, but I want you to really be on the lookout here. We're going to be seeing a lot of examples and challenges to each of these before we're done. And have I mentioned that this chapter is insanely long? XDAlthough this week's pages were mostly just stage setting, there's a lot of interesting stuff here too. Like, how Fara and Vincent neither confirmed nor denied that they were together. Or how Aiken asked about the compatibility of cis and trans people at all.©2004-2016Rain, all characters and all other aspects of the story are copyright material belonging to me.
