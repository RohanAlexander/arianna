Two women known as Diamond and Silk could be Donald Trump’s secret weapon against Hillary Clinton.

YouTube sensations Lynette Hardaway and Rochelle Richardson joined Trump for a rally in Greenville, North Carolina on Tuesday.

Hardaway tore into Clinton as Richardson provided verbal punctuation.

“Now she said the other day there’s smoke, but there’s no fire,” Hardaway said of Clinton.

“So I said, okay, Benghazi, housing emails on that private server, missing emails, pay-for-play schemes, funneling and tunneling money through that Clinton Foundation.

“Opening classified emails and she doesn’t even understand the ‘C’ stands for classified,” Hardaway continued.

“I guess she must have thought it stood for ‘Clinton cash,'” she said to roars from the audience.

“Now, Hillary, oh Hillary, we know that you told the FBI over 30-some times that you couldn’t remember, but in case you forgot, this is something we learned in school: There can be no smoke without fire!” Hardaway shouted as the audience erupted.

“Where there’s smoke, the alarms go off,” she continued, “and we the American people are alarmed.

“It is time for people to stop, drop and roll away from that Democratic plantation.”

She urged her fellow black Americans to join her on the “Trump train.”

“You don’t have to reach down for crumbs, you can start reaching up for the stars, baby,” Hardaway said.
