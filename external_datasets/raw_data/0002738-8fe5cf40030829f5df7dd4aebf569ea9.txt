1. The legislation will allow contractors to be secretly "blacklisted," and excluded from DoD contracting programs.

2. The blacklisting allowed under Section 815 could result in "de facto" debarments of federal contractors across the federal government without due process.

3. Section 815 does not require DoD to notify or justify its decision to blacklist companies.

4. DoD's determinations regarding its secret "blacklist" would be protected from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), protest at the Government Accountability Office (GAO), or action brought in the federal court system.

5. The legislation represents a reduction in competitiveness in federal contracting programs, and as a result could lead to increased costs of goods and services.

6. The legislation consolidates DoD acquisition authority on over $300 billion a year in defense contracts into the hands of a small group of high-level Pentagon officials.

7. The legislation will lead to a reduction in transparency, accountability and oversight in federal contracting programs and opens the door to unparalleled and perhaps unconstitutional abuse.

8. Could allow large contractors like Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman with significant clout at the Pentagon to eliminate their competitors with more efficient and cost effective products.
