Oregon State athletic department officials have Eastern Washington coach Beau Baldwin on a list of prospective candidates for the Beavers' head football coaching vacancy, according to a source with knowledge of the hiring process.

An EWU athletic department spokesman declined to comment Monday on whether OSU has asked the Eagles for permission to interview Baldwin.

Multiple news outlets have mentioned Baldwin in recent days as a possible successor to Mike Riley, who left OSU for Nebraska late last week after 14 years — 12 consecutive — in Corvallis. Since replacing Paul Wulff at EWU in 2008, Baldwin is 66-24. The 42-year-old has led the Eagles to four Big Sky Conference titles in five years, won the 2010 FCS national title and opened the 2013 season with a win over OSU at Reser Stadium.

Baldwin, who grew up in Tacoma, is considered an innovative offensive mind with a proven track record recruiting the Northwest. The majority of his roster is from west of the Cascades.

"By no means would I not be interested in hearing from a school at the Pac-12 level," Baldwin told The Spokesman-Review last week.

On Monday morning, 247sports.com's Josh Newberg reported that OSU has contacted former Michigan coach Brady Hoke. Hoke was a Beavers assistant from 1989-94, and he served as a Michigan assistant under then-Wolverines senior associate athletic director — and current OSU athletic director Bob De Carolis — from 1995-98.
