This vehicle was in a roll-over accident crushing all four doors, the roof and basically the whole car. The body shop did a excellent job bringing this car back to life. They still have some work to do but this is a long way from what it was.

This was the inside. Dust had been building up from sitting around a paint and body shop for months.

The exterior of the car was washed thoroughly, decontaminated and then sealed with Pinnacle Soveran.

The inside definitely needed the most attetion. There was dust in every crack and crevice. First all the top surface dirt had to be removed before we could start any real detail work. It took some time but the results were well worth it.

Lovely reflection.
