Pat Mahaney after the beating last August.

A North College Hill, OH man who was the victim of a brutal beating by a group of "bored" teenagers last August has died.

The Hamilton County Prosecutors office confirmed that 46-year-old Pat Mahaney passed away on Friday morning, less than a year after receiving a vicious beating that caused him to suffer internal bleeding and put him in the hospital for four days.

The cause of death is still unknown and results from Mahaney's autopsy will not be released for several weeks.

The man was assaulted on Aug. 11, 2012 in North College Hill by a group of teenagers, ages 13 and 14, who told police they were bored and looking for something to do.

North College Hill Police Chief Gary Foust told ABC that the juveniles jumped Mahaney from behind and hit him in the head with a six-pack of beer he had just bought.

"As they were approaching the individual they actually discussed this event, before actually doing the event," Foust said. Six teens were arrested in relation to the attack and charged with felonious assault and aggravated riot.

Three of the six teenagers pleaded guilty to the felonious assault charges after prosecutors agreed to drop the aggravated riot charges, ABC reported.

Should the autopsy reveal that Mahaney's death was caused or contributed to by the beating he received last year, the youngsters could face additional charges.
