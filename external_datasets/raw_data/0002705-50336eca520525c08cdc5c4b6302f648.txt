As some of you are aware just yesterday we announced Team ZZX's in development Zelda clone game that was coming to the ZX Spectrum at some point during 2018, well that game isn't the only one that's in development as we've just been told by the creator David Clarke, that he is also making a Legend of Zelda game, and that one is being developed using Arcade Game Designer. In light of this news there's even more footage to show, and even though it doesn't have sound, it looks pretty decent!According to David he is coding this for the ZX Spectrum as a learning exercise with more possibilities for the future, and although there is no sound, it will be added later. Furthermore he has also mentioned he is having a go at multiple enemies using the parama variable for the first time, although he has warned this may well be another unfinished project!: 1) Source
