Dearest Rebecca,

THANK YOU SO MUCH!! Wow, what an extremely awesome gift. I am humbled by your generosity. Thank you for being such a nice Santa.

I was chilling at work today when I was informed I had a parcel from Amazon waiting for me in the mail room. I hurried downstairs and thought 'shit that is a large box' when I saw my parcel. Retrieved box and excitedly scurried back up to my desk. It was the longest elevator ride of my life as I went back upstairs.

I opened up the box and inside was a familiar grey 'Magnum Essential Equipment' box. By this stage I was pretty excited. Seeing the Magnum box, I was ecstatic. I opened up that box and WOW, HOLY SHIT!. Santa Rebecca had gifted me a pair of Magnum Men's Elite Spider 8.0 Boots. I had a pair of these on my wishlist (my dream list as I call it) and had mentioned them in my Cozy Toes bio. Never did I imagine I would actually get a pair.

I love the outdoors, hiking, ruck marching, camping under the stars. Until recently I had had a pair of Magnum boots from my old Army days, until they finally succumbed to the Gods of wear and tear. I was pretty upset and was in dire need of a new pair. Thank you so much Rebecca, this has made for an excellent exchange and has made me so happy. I intend to go for a hike in them this weekend.

I have tried them on and had a brief stroll down the road in them. They are super comfortable and fit my size 13 feet just right. Awesome, awesome gift.

Rebecca, thank you again. All the best.
