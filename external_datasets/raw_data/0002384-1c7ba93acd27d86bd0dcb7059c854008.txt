Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice star Jesse Eisenberg is doing some damage control after comparing his experience at Comic-Con International: San Diego to “some kind of genocide.”

"Maybe on some cellular memory level, that's the only thing that seems like an equivalent social experience," Eisenberg told The Associated Press during another stop on The End of the Tour’s press tour. "Even if they're saying nice things, just being shouted at by thousands of people, it's horrifying."

He went on to state that he was honored to be at Comic-Con, and was only making use of hyperbole in his genocide remark. "I of course was using hyperbole to describe the sensory overload I experienced. I sometimes do employ that," he said. "I'm a normal person who has normal sensory experiences, so Comic-Con was very overwhelming for me. That said, it was really an honor to be on that end of such jubilation."

Eisenberg will play Lex Luthor in Batman v. Superman, and explained that such hyperbolic statements are just what’s expected of a villain. "They expect me to use hyperbole!" he said. "If I didn't I'd be the hero who usually speaks pretty practically."
