The past few days, it seems like every member of the media has been all over the attempt to conflate the Occupy Wall Street movement and the Tea Party. One person who’s not getting in the act, though? Glenn Beck. It’s unsurprising considering that Beck really, really likes the Tea Party and really, really doesn’t like Occupy Wall Street.

And so, today on his radio show, Beck had fairly negative things to say about one such person making those connections; Jon Stewart.

After playing clips of Stewart asking how the protesters are not like the Tea Party, Beck claimed he couldn’t fit all the reasons in even the two hour running length of his GBTV show.

After accusing the OWS crowd of wanting to murder and cannibalize rich people, Beck went onto Stewart personally.

“You know, Jon Stewart, I have absolutely no respect for you. You are not a thinking man at all.”

So Glenn Beck and Jon Stewart don’t see eye to eye on the issue. I will say this, that’s one way the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street are exactly, 100% identical.
