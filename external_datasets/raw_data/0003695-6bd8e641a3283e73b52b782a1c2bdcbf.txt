Tesco will scrap the sale of 5p bags in three weeks’ time, replacing single use carriers with 10p 'Bags for Life'.

The supermarket giant has sold over 700 million carrier bags a year since a 5p charge was introduced in 2015.

The fee lowered bag sales by 1.5 billion over two years but Tesco will stop selling them all together from August 28 in favour of reusable versions.

The decision comes following a 10-week trial at stores in Aberdeen, Dundee and Norwich.

Bag sales dropped by 25 per cent in these stores since the introduction of the scheme, Tesco bosses said.

Single use carriers will still be available to online shoppers alongside a bagless delivery option.

Profits raised from the 10p Bag for Life will fund community schemes across the UK.

Matt Davies, UK and ROI CEO at Tesco, said: “The number of bags being bought by our customers has already reduced dramatically.

"Today’s move will help our customers use even fewer bags but ensure that those sold in our stores continue to fund thousands of community projects across the country chosen by customers.

"It’s the right thing to do for the environment and for local communities.”
