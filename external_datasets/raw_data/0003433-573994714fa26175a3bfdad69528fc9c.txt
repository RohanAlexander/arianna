Defcon X was formed on the belief that efficient communication and effective cohesion can overcome overwhelming odds. We have a maximum player cap of 144 and prefer quality players over quantity of players. Not everyone will be accepted into our outfit.





The formula for our outfit is:

⦁ Training (e.g., 1v1/squad scrims, flight/ground school, and leading)

⦁ Operations (highly organized play)

⦁ Farming (fun and casual play)





Our Doctrine

On the battlefield, change is constant, and targets of opportunities appear and disappear quickly. We believe in a Quick Reaction Force that can quickly adapt to the change on the battlefield. A QRF can strike targets deep in enemy territory or stop a incoming attack by destroying High Value Targets that disrupts the enemies supply chains.





This QRF is team focused, highly organized, and comprised of highly motivated individuals. These individuals tirelessly train towards specialized warfare yielding loadouts designed specifically to counter enemies and their movements. In a QRF, each individual is given a unique assignment and responsibility that ensures the success of their squad/platoon/outfit goals.
