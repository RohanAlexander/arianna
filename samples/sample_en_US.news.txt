Together we devised this delicate savory custard with a silky texture and the merest hint of garlic. The individual custards make a special side dish for a beef or pork roast, or you can combine them with a salad for an unusual first course.
Here's how it works: One end of the tack hammer is magnetized. The upholsterer fills his mouth with little tacks then stretches whatever fabric he's applying till it's taut. The hammer goes to the lips, where a tack is "spit" onto it. Single tacks are applied to the bottom, each side and top of a piece's frame to hold the fabric in place, with the wrinkles stretched out each time, before it's all stapled down.

øAs Rick shared, "My partner had moved on with his life. But there I was left stewing, hurt and bitter. I allowed him to determine my mood and my happiness.

The Mistake: I got an opportunity to form a partnership and buy Sawmill Creek Resort several years after I worked as a general contractor on the condominiums at the property.

The lesson buried in watching the Blazers play up-tempo and look like more fun is too difficult to miss. Remember, they're more enjoyable to watch, but not better. A Roy-led team would crush this No. 8-seed product that is bringing smiles to faces.
When we moved into our house, it had an above-ground pool and every spring, frogs would lay egg masses in the water on the cover. I'd recruit my husband and we'd carefully net the gelatinous eggs and painstakingly walk them down a steep hill to a manmade pond, where we'd deposit them. I thought I was helping oodles of future frogs by righting a bad decision their parents had made in egg-laying.

It might be useful to take a step back in understanding that the site of the Battle of Princeton counterattack was envisioned from the beginning to be a vital part of Princeton Battlefield State Park. In 1944, C.S. Sincerbeaux prepared a map showing Washington’s counterattack on what is now the proposed faculty housing site. This map became the basis for Gov. Walter Edge’s park boundary lines. The Institute for Advanced Study received a copy of the map and indicated that it was favorably disposed to working with the governor in putting the park together. Then, in 1945, the institute purchased 129.99 acres from Robert Maxwell, including the site of the counterattack — a site that Gov. Edge passionately wanted to be in the park. In 1947, Mr. Maxell and Mrs. Agnes Pyne Hudson both gave property to the park; other parcels were purchased, some acquired under the threat of eminent domain.
The biggest cheer after Alomar popped out of the dugout went to Browns president Mike Holmgren, who was sitting behind the Indians dugout and popped up, larger than life, on the Jumbotron in the middle of the fifth inning. Facing their own eternal rebuilding, the Browns might find the cheers last only until fans see quarterback question marks Jake Delhomme or Seneca Wallace throw a pass.
Becker's was founded by Eva Becker, described by her family as a short, stocky no-nonsense pioneering businesswoman who for decades oversaw employees and customers with a firm hand.

Rather than ignore the rantings of just one of its 30,000 employees, Goldman put its communications machine into over-drive. A memo from CEO Lloyd Blankfein even outlined the fact that 89 percent of the 85 percent of Goldman employees who responded to a company survey said they believe the firm provides excellent service to its clients. Huh? By my math that means 25 percent of Goldmanites don’t believe that to be the case, or were too lazy to vote. No matter, the firm continued its pattern of protesting too much.

"I was also very scared of guns coming into this," Smulders said. "So I had him bring a bunch of his guns  unloaded  to my house and had him just break it down. ... All these things that I just wanted to have in my body and wanted to be really comfortable with."

Founder and primary funder, Ron Clutter, has had his reasons for keeping the project quiet.
Goodell has said that time and again, but the commissioner remains an employee. A powerful employee, for sure, but he has 32 bosses, and if one of those captains wants to sail away - as we've seen with the Raiders, Cardinals, Browns, Colts and Oilers/Titans - there's really not much he can do about it. Except these franchises are running out of places to move where they'll build zillion-dollar stadiums.
Remember, the Hyde Park progressive took searing heat from lakefront liberals when she successfully pushed Joe Berrios over Forrest Claypool for Cook County assessor in 2010. Her rationale: Berrios is a veteran champion for minority access to jobs, contracts and clout. Claypool had never even been at the table.

You aren't going to see a lot of 1,000 yard receivers at Oregon, no matter how long Chip stays because throwing the ball is a change of pace play in this offense. The main problem with the receiver corp last year was drops and the lack of an explosive downfield threat. If even one of our 4 star redshirts emerges, both of those problems should be solved.
Tabak also took another tack. In 20 instances since Harris took office, homicide investigators went straight to judges to issue so-called Ramey warrants for murder suspects, instead of the usual method of submitting cases to prosecutors for a charging decision.

The strangest situation was when I was stopped for speeding by the notoriously corrupt police. When the officer pulled me over, I pretended I didn't understand Spanish, hoping he might give up and just let me go. I ended up going native. I gave the officer enough money to treat himself and his senora to a steak dinner, then was allowed to go on my way. Of course, no ticket was issued. It was both frightening and amusing.

Nothing compares to Fenway in terms of the close proximity of the stands and the knowledge of the fans. Ignore (if you can) the arrogance of Red Sox fans. And appreciate the fact that they cheer when a hitter grounds out to second to move the runner along from second to third. Wrigley is all about the party in the bleachers (which is fun in its own right). Fenway is pure baseball.

One good measure of valuation is the price-to-earnings ratio, or P/E ratio: the value of the company divided by its earnings, or how much money it makes after it pays for its costs. P/E is a good measure of valuation because P/E tells you how much investors expect the company to grow in the future. (This is because what an asset is worth is, in theory at least, the "net present value of its future cash flows", or how much you're paying now for the money it's going to make in the future. So the higher the P/E ratio, the more money you expect the company to make in the future.)

The restaurant's vegetable "coins" ($13) are reminiscent of Indian kofta - they're fried patties of broccoli, cauliflower, carrots and celery. But here they're served in Manchurian sauce, a puree of broccoli with soy sauce, onion and ginger. The result is a comforting dish, if a little greasy, though it's good for absorbing spiciness.
Last Wednesday, the night Grant Achatz's Next opened on Fulton Market, a man who lives in the neighborhood came in as the last table was being served.

GM had requested a total of $30 billion, and it's unclear just how much of that the government is willing to give.
But it is inaccurate to frame this debate as simply another battle between those who care about the environment and those who want to exploit it. The environmentalists who tout wind energy and other relatively green sources of energy point out that we are producing and consuming energy in such a manner as to throw the globe's human and ecological future into doubt. Runte appears to believe that to acknowledge this amounts to giving "everything called 'renewable' ... a pass." I worry that his argument amounts to giving everything deemed "scenic" a pass while ignoring or minimizing the dire threats posed to humans and non-humans by our reckless levels of consumption.
The judge made some comparisons to earlier cases in the same scandal and said the heaviest factor is the need to restore public trust.

In my teens, I moved away from Chinese culture and history  being Chinese in no way helped me fit in outside the home.

It's a very unsettling time. It's all been driven by this crazy madhouse pursuit of television dollars - perceived to be there in football. I've always thought the basketball side of this has gotten the short-shrift. It's just kind of along for the ride. People say: "Oh, Colorado's in the Pac-12? That's right, their football team just went over there." Well guess what, their basketball team just put that move on the map. That was a huge win for the CU program. Huge.

All that notwithstanding, it is a strange time in history for self-appointed advocates for women to feel oppressed on their behalf. They must have missed the growing literature on "The End of Men" and similar themes. Women earn about 60 percent of bachelor's and master's degrees, and are reaching parity with men in medical and law schools. Their attitudes to work are changing. In a historic reversal, more young women ages 18 to 34 (66 percent) than young men (59 percent) say high-paying work is one of the most important things or very important, according to a new Pew survey.

Bead refers to the trail of bubbles that rises from the bottom of the glass.

The highs and lows tell me the menu needs cutting. Clemons is a talented and ambitious guy. But it takes discipline to come up with ideas, then give them the ax if they don't work. I would say one-third of the menu could be trimmed. That would make quality control easier, and the remaining dishes could get even better.

“We were there to be intimate with each other, so I’m sure the windows weren’t open." He added, "Our intentions were to get intimate and we wanted privacy."
Less successful was English's version of surf and turf ($36), the crossroads between steak and seafood. It's something of a signature dish for him, cutting a pocket into a strip steak and stuffing in blue cheese and fried oysters. These are some of my favorite foods, so the combination held great promise. But the meat was lukewarm and the oysters were close to room temperature, which isn't a pleasant state for fried oysters. What should have been three aces turned into a losing hand.

In fact, if youre going to try to rationalize a stupid action by an athlete over the last week, youd have a much easier time doing it with Amare Stoudemire. Following the Knicks' 104-94 Game 2 loss to the Heat, Stoudemire punched the door that held a fire extinguisher and cut his hand. Reports still vary on how serious the cuts are, but he clearly wont play Thursday in Game 3 in New York and hes probably done for the series, which means hes probably done for the season. Stoudemire was immediately branded stupid, selfish and guilty of an unforgivable act.
Kean also won Institutional Grant Awards for two of its United States Department of Education grant-funded projects: the Garden State Partnership for Teacher Quality (GSPTQ) and the New Vistas Teacher Project.

It sparked an early decision on the forced departure of the state-appointed school superintendent of Newark. It forged one of the most unusual alliances New Jersey has seen — between a big city mayor and a governor from opposing parties, and it came despite initial objections by some education reformers and others, who privately expressed concerns to the governor about Booker’s role and his ability to deliver reform.

Let's also stipulate that Mr. Nighy is one of the great comic actors of any time. Here, however, he's a glum presence in a role of bleak passivity. Ms. Smith spends most of her screen time in a wheelchair, complaining nastily about everything under the Jaipur sun. Dev Patel has been encouraged, or allowed, by the director, John Madden, to overact wildly and wave his arms grotesquely as the hotel's desperate young proprietor. Only Ms. Dench gets to play a scene worthy of her gifts. Her character, Evelyn Greenslade, has gone out and hustled herself a job at an Indian call center; suddenly she's plunged into the witty give and take of teaching a young Indian woman how to keep a client on the line. The scene is about listening well, thinking quickly and responding creatively. Unlike the rest of this inert film, it's alive.

8:28 p.m.: Lady Gaga's "Born This Way" was a bit overblown but okay. Was she lip-syncing? I thought so at first, but the ending, at least, seemed "live." Maybe she switched over at some point, after the heavy-duty dancing was over?
Really, there should be two sets of expectations for the Broncos in 2012. The first set of expectations assumes Peyton Manning is healthy and as able as he was earlier in his career. If that is the case, they look like the best team in the AFC West and one of the best teams in the conference.

Saturday's game was the first for Rapids forward Brian Mullan against the Sounders since his two-footed sliding tackle last April 22 in Colorado left speedy Seattle midfielder Steve Zakuani with a broken right leg. Mullan served an MLS record-tying 10-game suspension, which ended before the return match in Seattle on July 16. But he did not make that trip because of back spasms, which also had kept him out of another game before that.

Across the nation there have been few successful recall attempts. Before California's 2003 recall election, in which Gray Davis was replaced by Arnold Schwarzenegger, the only other recall of a governor occurred in North Dakota in 1921. In 1988, Arizona voters got enough signatures to have a recall election for Gov. Evan Mecham, but he was impeached before the vote.
At the Biden group's last meeting Wednesday, discussions over whether to include taxes were particularly contentious, Mr. Cantor said. This was unlike most meetings over the past seven weeks, in which Mr. Biden kept the talks focused on areas of possible agreement on spending cuts, while sidestepping the tax issue.
As logging industrialized, poor men became rich, and a rich landscape became poor. After arriving in America in 1852 as an 18-year-old German immigrant, Frederick Weyerhaeuser later controlled a logging empire valued at $70 million. Apart from canny purchasing of timberlands around the Great Lakes, his masterstroke was forming a syndicate of formerly rival lumber companies. By breaking logjams of wood being floated down the Mississippi, everyone's production improved; at the same time, cut land around the Great Lakes became a tinderbox. In 1871, Wisconsin's Peshtigo fire seared 2,000 square miles and claimed more than a thousand lives. In the Badger State alone, more fires followed in 1891, 1894, 1897, 1908, 1910, 1923, 1931 and 1936. "Losing half a million acres in a year was almost commonplace," Rutkow observes.

Let me also say to the people of Illinois how they honored me by electing me their governor twice, and how honored I was to serve them as governor, to serve the people of the North and North West Side in this neighborhood and in neighborhoods. I grew up in Congress for six years, to serve as a state lawmaker for four years. I want you all to know you honored me with that privilege. I believe I always, always thought about what was right for the people, and I am proud as I leave and enter the next part of what is a dark and hard journey, that I can take with me the sense of accomplishment, the real belief, that the things that I did as governor, the things that I did in Congress have actually helped real ordinary people.

Here's a delicious way to learn: the "Century of Ports" gift box from Taylor Fladgate. It contains 375 ml bottles of Taylor Fladgate 10- year-old, 20-year-old, 30-year-old and 40-year-old tawny Port. The formidable price tag of $225 isn't so bad when you consider that a full bottle of 40-year-old costs about $150, and a full bottle of the 30-year-old goes for about $110 if you can find it; 30-year-old tawny Ports are somewhat rare.

Which is not to say that a vacation to Hawaii can be done on a dime. We pounced on a $550 round-trip airfare, but even that meant $2,200 for a family of four. Because it was our first visit, we hopscotched among three islands – the Big Island, Oahu and Kauai – which meant $60-per-person flights from one island to the next. My husband covered six nights' lodging for free by saving hotel credit card points for more than a year, but the one hotel night we paid for ran $350.

Russo was right. His show is freewheeling and offbeat — and a surprise hit. That program director isn't at the station anymore, but program director and radio veteran Leslie Fram has given the deejay the liberty to be as playful as he wants to be.

Russo chases whims: On his March 6 show, he spun four songs in a row with the word "alligator" in their titles.

But other days, it's not an easy job. People think, "Well, anybody can be the boss." But there are days when it actually is pretty tough. . . .

Hey, Tony: Read your article about kickers becoming "too good." I'd like to get your opinion on the following rule change which would take effect when I become king: On kickoffs, if the ball is kicked out-of-bounds on the fly, penalty places the ball on the 40, as presently. If it bounces or rolls out-of-bounds before getting to the end zone, the receiving team takes possession at that yard line, just like a punt. I think the change would add an interesting element to the game, requiring more precision than distance kicking, and may cause receiving teams to use two returners to cover the field, reducing the number of blockers by one, or risk bad field position. BTW, I happen to enjoy watching teams (not QB'd by Elway) try to succeed in 90-yard drives. -- Seren Hrachian, Athens, N.Y.

On the upside, the sector provides lots of jobs for workers with little special education or training. When the industry is thriving, it expands and hires quickly. But those positions often come with low pay and minimal benefits: On average, leisure-and-hospitality workers make a little more than $11 an hour, according to the U.S. Labor Department. Manufacturing jobs, on average, pay about twice that.

I want serious cuts in spending and the elimination of whole departments. Let's not have a bunch of huffing and puffing about trivial amounts. I don't want Republicans to vote a simple “yes” or “no” on their desires.
But Biden's choice of words, and his expression of empathy for same-sex couples, suggests it is at least a subject of discussion at the White House.
"Hell's Angels" completes that night. It's best remembered today not for Harlow's vivid performance ("Would you be shocked if I put on something more comfortable?" is her most famous line) but for the overall extravagance of a production that cost a then-record $4 million and exposed an estimated 560 hours of film. Producer-director Hughes acquired about 40 aircraft — and crashed a few of them — for this story of U.S. pilots in Britain's World War I Royal Flying Corps.

There is no victory in sight, no chance to defeat the Taliban, no reason to continue to engage in a fragile and contentious alliance with a regional thug like Hamid Karzai, no rational explanation of why we continue to send our best soldiers into a war they have no chance to win if we stay in the hills of Afghanistan forever. Of all the disappointments of the Obama administration, real and imagined, all the supposed failures against which the Republicans candidates continue to bang away and about which the tinhorn, bullhorn patriots of the media continue to scream, here is the one most real: That Obama sent 30,000 more troops into Afghanistan when the ones he had there, including the ones who have died there since his own surge, should have been on their way home. Ten years into this, we are supposed to believe that things will somehow be better in one more year, that we can find some way to claim victory, or honor, when both are impossible in Afghanistan. While McClanahan and Lupica question President Obama's policies in regard to Afghanistan, the president and British Prime Minister David Cameron appeared together last week and said they "remained committed to completing the mission successfully by turning over security responsibility to Afghan forces by the end of 2014" (CNN):

øSince not all student loans participate in IBR or loan forgiveness, you could certainly ask your lender about a graduated payment. Graduated payments result in a lower payment for a pre-determined amount of time, but the payments will eventually increase. This could make sense if you felt something will change in your financial situation. Make sure to ask the lender in advance what your payment will be when it increases, because it will be necessary to have the income to meet this payment further down the road.

Good luck to the members, whoever they may be. Finding silly, wasteful government enterprises will be a cinch. The hard part will be defining "silly" and "wasteful."
Although there is a Number 7 on the label, this is a nonvintage wine. A winery spokeswoman said the pinot noir in the blend had been aged in oak for a year longer than the zinfandel and the syrah. The "7" is a way to identify the bottling. In this bottling, the wine is made of 50 percent syrah, 28 percent pinot noir and 22 percent zinfandel. The label also describes Meditrina as an "American" wine rather than an Oregon wine. The spokeswoman said that was because the zinfandel grapes had been grown in California.

Ever wonder why this address came to symbolize Tinseltown? Well, a brick structure at that corner, the Taft Building (1680 N. Vine St.), was where most of the studios and many agents had offices. This made it a busy spot for actors looking for work.

In the old days of pit trading, where Gruzynski could use his 6-foot-5 stature to get attention, the whole point of an exchange membership was to have market access. Locals, independent pit traders, "were on the floor and they were faster than the people in the tractors" who invested in commodities, Gruzynski said. Now, he said, the advantage is going to firms that spend heavily in an "arms race" for the latest technology.

That's just one example of Chloe's unapologetically bad behavior. She conveniently gets a 13-year-old kid tipsy to make him spill dirt about June's fiance, Steven (Tate Ellington), hides questionable Chinese energy pills in the furniture to sell and thinks nothing of walking out of a bar without paying for her drinks. Chloe pulls even more outrageous stunts in the first three episodes of the new show but since they involve major plot developments, I'll leave them for viewers to discover on their own.

The long-awaited return of outfielder-first baseman Allen Craig became official Tuesday, when the club activated him from the disabled list before the series opener against the Pittsburgh Pirates.
What McCoy said to his teammates before that game could become part of Cleveland lore if McCoy becomes all some think he can be. "The hay is in the barn," he said in the players meeting the night before the game. Translating that for the "city folk," as McCoy said, it meant he and the team had done all the meat-and-potatoes preparation. It meant he was ready, all the way to standing, instinctively, as a leader would, when he spoke in a team meeting, instead of sitting, as the other quarterbacks had done.

The FJP, partly in an attempt to gain leverage in its battle to oust the military-appointed cabinet, has held out on approving the program.

The report found that managers’ emphasis on referrals created a perception among BDOs that there was a quota system in place, and that promotions depended on their producing high numbers. The report said one of the managers, George Schultz, instructed officers to manipulate a point system used to assess whether a passenger’s behavior merits referral to law enforcement officers, or LEOs. The report said the practice was so widespread that transportation security officers, or TSOs, and supervisory TSOs, who are not involved in behavior detection, eventually confronted behavior detection managers Robert Hakius and Joseog Yurechko about it.

CHATHAM TWP. — Last November, Chatham Township Administrator Thomas Ciccarone signed a contract with Hunter Technologies to provide phone service to all township facilities, including the Police Department and Department of Public Works. He later conceded he had no legal authority to sign the $63,000 contract because he needs Committee approval before purchasing anything costing more than $17,500. At the time, the company was not a qualified contractor on the state’s list of approved vendors. It is now.

Snapshot: This deciduous tree adds interest to the garden year-round. In spring, it bears hundreds of large, frilly white flowers that give this popular ornamental tree its nickname. The impressive blooms appear shortly after the first leaves and hold their form for about three weeks. In summer, the attractive green foliage provides shade. In autumn, the leaves turn bright yellow before falling. That reveals the attractive grooved bark, which puts on its own interesting show in winter as it peels. This tree, which tends to grow with multiple trunks, is not fussy, can tolerate all sorts of soils and has no known diseases. You can see specimens in the Arboretum Terrace Garden on the UC Davis campus.

Consumers choose goat's milk because they perceive it as less allergenic, easier to digest and more healthful all round than cow's milk. Some of those perceptions may be wrong.

There is incentive on both sides to resolve the impasse over the NATO supply route. The U.S. has had to spend considerably more money over the past few months shipping supplies to Afghanistan through the more expensive northern route that runs through Central Asia.

The home screens are a combination of icons, widgets, a carousel app wheel and a so-called Lenovo Launcher for quick access to frequently used apps, but I found the overall software interface to be cluttered and a little confusing. I rarely used the four physical buttons at the bottom of the screen (in portrait mode) for locking the screen, browsing, returning to a previous screen, and returning to the home screen.

2. I read a Tweet the other night, sweeping the dirt out from under the, uh, rug. It was about Kansas coach Bill Self, and it made the same claim -- that Self's immaculately coiffed hair was not what it appeared to be -- as my friend, the retired Toledo Blade columnist John Gugger, suspected.

Peering intently, I confirmed Gugger's suspicion, due to a small strip of bald skin visible only at close range. I never wrote it, but now I've got to defend my peerless investigative powers and my buddy's uncanny instincts.

The frequency of this changes from infancy to adulthood, with more than 50 percent of infants refluxing during a 24-hour period and only 10 percent of adults doing the same. The reason for this is the immaturity of the sphincter that separates the stomach from the esophagus. Even when stomach contents make their way into the esophagus, there are mechanisms in place to squeeze these contents back into the stomach rapidly. When we have overwhelming amounts of stomach contents or improper clearance mechanisms, the result is gastro-esophageal reflux disease.

He does an awful lot of posing, and he has the added historical misfortune of looking like Marty Feldman in "Young Frankenstein." One of my readers said Rod Stewart, and I can see that, too, but I think Rod Stewart has more irony and self-awareness. Perhaps the best way of putting it is that Dieudonné looks like Marty Feldman singing "Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?" Zaniness plus confidence.

For Classen's part, he said that identifying his anonymous critic was important, not because he slammed the Examiner, but "because he is a powerful person. It's because he has the ear of important people. And they don't know who he is."

The perennial, imported from Asia as an ornamental, was already a problem in Vermont and a dozen other states in the Northeast, the Pacific Northwest and the Midwest.

The film can be sometimes brutal to watch; there’s a particularly nasty rape scene, some gory crimes and a fairly consistent theme of torture and abuse. Ironically, though, none of it comes off as exploitative; like “Silence of the Lambs,” this is a feminist thriller.
"It's more like a trading range right now," he said.
Although historically, officers have served in the centralized booking role, that doesn't mean a civilian can't be trained to perform the duties.

The Arnold branch of the Jefferson County Library has a great idea. Its Leap Year program for ages 3 to 12 gets hopping with "Get Froggy with It."

It's not yet clear when the dealerships will be able to argue their cases at the state level. Attorneys on both sides said appeals to the federal court ruling could delay action in Ohio.

But perhaps it isa good thing to some extent. Because startlingly absent - or not so startlingly, if you've followed our judicial elections over the years - on this very early list is anyone from the civil or criminal-defense bars. That is because it is very hard to beat someone with "deputy district attorney" as their ballot designation in conservative, law-and-order Orange County. The necessary diversity of the bench, therefore, must rely on the gubernatorial appointment process, which is political, yes, but also involves stringent vetting by a bipartisan commission of lawyers.

He was the referee right in front of the game-ending play between Memphis and Arizona, where Wesley Witherspoon's potential game-tying layup was thwarted when Wildcats star Derrick Williams blocked it. Only Williams' block was accompanied by an obvious foul right in front of Burr. When is the NCAA going to step in and give Burr an actual punishment for blowing these game-deciding calls?

So Mr. Obama is willing to cut current entitlements on grounds that they are unaffordable, but he's taken what may be the most expensive entitlement off the table.

Ms. Rosen beat a hasty retreat, saying: "As a mom, I know that raising children is the hardest job there is. As a pundit, I know my words on CNN last night were poorly chosen."

My history on the ice is about as extensive as one might expect of a guy raised amid the palm trees of South Florida. As the holidays approached, my friends and I would bundle up and head to the Polar Palace in Hialeah, a venue more like a converted warehouse than a palace. The main attraction, other than the ice, was the giant stuffed polar bear watching over us as we stumbled around the rink.

Since coming together in Dayton nearly 30 years ago, Guided by Voices has endured despite more employee turnover than a fast-food franchise. "Let's Go Eat the Factory," the quintessential indie-rock group's 16th album (and first since a 2004 "farewell" tour), reunites mainstay frontman Robert Pollard with the band's mid-'90s lineup, including multi-instrumentalist Tobin Sprout. A few tracks feel more like fragments than proper songs, but GBV fans will find plenty to rejoice about here, including "Laundry and Lasers," the Krispy Kreme-plugging "Doughnut for a Snowman" and "The Unsinkable Fats Domino," a stomper about invincibility.

Without question, collective bargaining takes the biggest hit in the reorganization being proposed, and some of the provisions may go too far. But the general direction is about restoring a balance between workers' interests and the rights of taxpayers in the city. By some measures, Detroit's fixed costs (which include the city's massive pension and retiree health care liabilities) eat up between 35 and 42 cents of every dollar the city has, which means the city spends between a third and a half of its money before it puts a single cop on the streets, turns on a single light or sends a bus down Woodward Avenue.

Burton, an under-the-radar free agent signing during the offseason, entered Wednesday with a 2.25 ERA but on a monster run of 10 2/3 hitless innings. A single by the Angels' Vernon Wells on April 12 was the last hit off him.

Mr. Nixon proposed and Missouri representatives passed a budget that uses a tax amnesty program to recover $70 million in back taxes owed by corporations and private citizens. Seems like a reasonable and fair solution, right? The Missouri Senate doesn't think so. Sen.

It’s not even close," said Dan O’Flaherty a Columbia economist who recently published a paper comparing Newark to New York City in 1975, when an overextension of that city’s financial commitments caused it to go bankrupt.

One of football’s greatest linebackers is dead now, and in the most direct way he apparently did this to himself by pulling the trigger.

Not only does President Obama pale in comparison to King, but does he really think that Jesus sanctions his anti-life policies of contraception, homosexuality and abortion? Does he really believe that the murder of innocent children through abortion is good for the economy? Whose economy? On top of that, he has the twisted audacity to suggest those who oppose his anti-life policies are chattels to a "phony religiosity." Citizens, don't be fooled again!

Mothers once had to share a crammed room with little privacy, but now most hospitals offer them large private rooms where a spouse or partner can spend the night and help care for the new arrival. Hardwood floors have replaced cold linoleum, and windows once covered by commercial white blinds are now often dressed with frilly curtains.
It is hardest on the spouse left behind to shoulder all responsibilities and duties. Children are typically resilient. I don't remember much of that time when he was gone, but when I asked my parents about it recently, the memory sounded vivid in their voices.

U.S. Magistrate Judge Jeffrey Keyes denied that request Tuesday, saying he lacked specific details about the proposed disclosures. He noted that the parties in the civil suit haven't reached an agreement about a proposed confidentiality order.

This is the proper role of government, not private litigants."

SpearIt (his professional name) and his wife, Vishakha, moved to St. Louis a little more than a year ago after a decade in California. They had never used a baby sitter or nanny for their young children, and as a professor, SpearIt had the flexibility to spend a lot of time at home with the babies. The kids had always been with us, he said. Around the time their eldest would be starting preschool, they decided it would be better to home-school because of Vishakha's background in education. They also thought that there was no reason to separate from the kids at such an early age. Recently, an opportunity arose for their son to attend a language immersion charter school close to their home, so their 5-year-old son will be starting kindergarten at a school away from home this fall. Soon after, SpearIt will head back to the classroom as a law professor. He talked about preparing his son for the transition ahead.

Q: My son-in-law collects baseballs. He keeps them in protective cases displayed on a lower shelf in the TV room. He and my daughter have three children ages 2, 3 and 5, and he is quite stern with them about not touching the cases. However, as their grandfather, I know that it is a disaster waiting to happen because the kids, who are all three boys, do not understand what the big deal is with touching them. They are, after all, balls. How can I try to get my son-in-law to consider putting the cases up where they cannot be reached without sounding like a know-it-all, nagging grandfather?

We tried two more pizzas, both with great toppings, but never found the tender chewy crust of the kid's pie. Fruity tomatoes and lots of fresh mozzarella in the margarita ($15) proved too wet for the much larger crust.

Where or how R.C. came upon the term "voluntaryist" remains a mystery. He may have come across it in his religious studies, since the term was originality applied to the manner in which churches were voluntarily supported in this country and England, as opposed to the establishment and funding of a State church. R.C. was not totally anti-electoral, for he did support Goldwater in his bid for the presidency. He was, however, clearly an advocate of an all-voluntary society, one in which the person who did not wish to pay for government protection should not receive such protection nor be forced to pay for a service he did not receive. In the latter part of 1958 and the early part of 1959, he gave several public talks to such groups as the Unitarian Fellowship of Orange County and the Exchange Club of Santa Ana. The subject of these presentations was "voluntaryism." He chose this theme because he sincerely thought that to the degree that more and more people believed in and practiced voluntaryism "the more they will increase their happiness, their physical and spiritual health, their peace of mind and their prosperity." The message of Jesus Christ, and as R.C. was to fondly add, the Ten Commandments, The Golden Rule and the Declaration of Independence, was clearly voluntaryist at heart. "If it is harmful for one to get things on an involuntary basis, or two people, it is harmful for any number of people or for a government to got things by using involuntary means." He was optimistic that voluntaryism would triumph, just as chattel slavery had been abolished in this country. In his 1956 column, quoted above, he wrote that

I look at it, and can't help thinking she is still praying for me.
If the United States had taken the lead by recognizing the Transitional Council earlier to help to guide its agenda, or had focused on taking out Khadafy sooner and made it clear from the start that NATO wasn’t going to be subverted into an instrument of European oil interests, some, if not all, of this might have been prevented.

Many of these albums were superior to Slim Shady’s comeback effort. The Grammy voters, however, stubbornly refused to demonstrate any imagination or perspective in the Best Rap Album category. If Eminem is up for it, he’s going to get it, and they’re not going to think about it any harder than that.

Explicitly asking applicants whether they are U.S. citizens, green-card holders or otherwise authorized to work is easy - and crucial - although I've discovered that simply asking whether someone is "willing and able to work legally" doesn't always translate.

øBut this begs the question - how exactly do you do it? When someone goes the self-employment route, they usually know a lot about the sort of business they may want to start (the gardener knows plants, the graphic artist knows how to design a website).

"I'm still juggling," said Houston, 46, in her studio aerie on a hill just south of Cornelius. Painting, she said, gives her time to be there for her husband and two elementary school-aged sons, to help with her husband's business, to remodel yet another house, learn Spanish, travel and teach.

Glasgow, Ky., was sentenced today to seven years in prison for an October 2009 plot to steal a gas station's cash as an employee deposited it at a bank.
Ultimately, this enchanting tale is a Zen analogue to the story of Jesus' Sermon on the Mount, in which Jesus transforms biblical vengeance into a Christian's duty to "turn the other cheek." The harsh treatment he has received for 40 years, and his willingness to forgive all those who have done him harm, makes Thich Nhat Hanh the spiritual heir of, coincidentally, a Zen legend and a good Christian's first maxim.

Even China's emerging eco-activists admit that on paper it has decent environmental laws. But enforcement remains sporadic, and in the pecking order of China's one-party government -- where local and regional officials are essentially junior executives out to impress the home office in Beijing -- nothing makes a career shine like presiding over strong economic growth. Some top officials have suggested using a "green GDP" to evaluate local officials, but the idea has yet to catch fire.

• Ben Golliver, Blazersedge.com: From Portland's perspective -- should this report prove to be accurate -- this isn't a major win or a major loss. There's certainly the risk of injury to be weighed, as Batum did miss a significant portion of the 2009-2010 season following shoulder surgery before bouncing back to play in 80 games last year. When factoring in the potential benefits of him playing against quality competition and continuing to develop, though, this is basically a wash.

I agree that adding a deep-watering system is important for maintaining a healthy tree. First, when designing the artificial turf layout, consider maintaining a large gap around the perimeter of the tree trunk, so you have someplace to access and feed the surrounding soil. Consider using this border space to plant understory plantings. Run irrigation to these plants, so the remnant water will also feed the pine tree. This represents good design and will also transition the tree from the grass area.

A He was always trying to find the ideal piano -- extremely difficult to do, when you're unable to hear. So it's difficult to clearly say what he was looking for in a piano, because the sound he was seeking maybe was more in his head.

But the real fascination lies in Turner's zany juxtapositions of eclectic furniture, collections and art. His Monterey-style furniture, fabricated by Mason Manufacturing for Barker Bros. from 1929 through the mid-'40s, dominates most of the rooms.

Act 2: DVRs begin to count. Or rather, the Nielsen ratings people start to count DVR usage. For years The Office and 30 Rock languished in the ratings, and the boost they got from time-shifting (not to mention rentals on iTunes) was crucial to their success. For The Office in particular it was helpful, because its mockumentary format was a genuine experiment in network comedy. Had it been allowed to die, it's unlikely ABC would have greenlit Modern Family, TV's first mockumentary with mass appeal.

Micheal Ray Richardson’s drug habit was an anvil hanging over the team throughout the 36 months he wore a Nets jersey, but when his mind was unpolluted and his eyes were clear, he was the second-best point guard in the NBA behind Magic Johnson.

If the variable f, for fandom, is constant, you always make more money under Scenario A – always. This is why things will probably never change.

The judges aren't so crazy about Peach's polka-dot concoction, her third try at an ensemble. Michael says it looks like an Amish cocktail dress.

The appeals court did not consider the merits of Cowher’s case, only whether he has standing to pursue it. The suit, alleging discrimination that created a hostile work environment, had been dismissed by a Superior Court judge who ruled that because Cowher was not a Jew, he could not sue.
In his third year as head coach, Barnes said the quiet and humble Valentine is learning how to be more of a team leader. He said that without the 5-foot-5 fireplug, the Spartans would not have near as many numbers.
The waterfront property falls within the 100-foot buffer known as the Chesapeake Bay's Critical Area, and disturbing the land comes under state and local regulation.
We're sure you'd probably never swig that much soda (right?!?), but teens average 73 grams of HFCS a day, and most people take in about 55 grams, mainly from the HFCS in sweet drinks, desserts and candy, which your body absorbs in a flash. The fructose in fruit, by contrast, gets absorbed slowly and safely. (Side note: HFCS also might contribute to obesity by interfering with "I'm full" brain signals.)
3. Amistad (1997) Roger Sherman Baldwin: McConaughey plays an attorney, fighting for the freedom of a slave, who solicits help from the aging and bitter John Quincy Adams (Anthony Hopkins). While Hopkins' role is the juiciest, McConaughey is strong in support of this moving, dramatic movie.
Not to fear. Waxman, the liberal lion who chairs the House Energy and Commerce Committee, is on the case. He doesn't want to change the tax provision; he wants to browbeat the affected corporations. He has called the CEOs of AT&T, Caterpillar and Deere to testify before his committee, accompanying his summons with a far-reaching document request lest the corporations miss the point: This is naked political harassment.
The getaway vehicle, a minivan registered to the boy's mother, was recovered. The weapon used in the killing is still outstanding, Bertagna said.
The unemployment rate has begun to drop— and today is below, not above, the national average.
When he said recently that he wanted to spend a few nights on the remote Powell Plateau, overlooking some of the finest vistas in the Grand Canyon, I immediately applied for a backcountry permit from the national park. I'd never been to the North Rim or heard of the Powell Plateau, but if John wanted to go there, that was all I needed to know.
Almost half the book covers the 47 days between the assassination and Johnson’s Jan. 8 State of the Union address. In that span he began breaking the congressional logjam against liberal legislation that had existed since 1938 when the nation, recoiling against Franklin Roosevelt’s plan to “pack” the Supreme Court, produced a durable congressional coalition of Republicans and Southern Democrats.
Demchik said Brooklyn should invite Cleveland Cavaliers majority owner Dan Gilbert to see what he could do with the soon-to-be-vacant 100 acres of land.
Every player eligible for the draft is then ranked by each team, usually with numerical grades down to the tenth — 7.8, 7.7, 7.6 and on down. Each team then slots those numerical grades to fit the draft to decide what picks would be worthy of a particular grade.

Sometimes a poor night's sleep feels outside of your control, but often a solution can be found through a trip to the doctor. If after following healthy sleep practices you continue to struggle with sleep, there may be an underlying sleep disorder that you and your doctor can address together. It may be time to see your doctor if you are dissatisfied with the quality or quantity of your sleep, routinely feeling sleepy during the day or are experiencing unusual behaviors while asleep, such as sleep walking, sleep talking, persistent snoring or problems breathing.
Only 30%-35% of women in trials of Lybrel had no bleeding or spotting, which could last four to five days, Shames said. Half dropped out; of those who stuck with it, 59% didn't bleed by their 13th month on the pill.

The opponent: With 1,027 yards on the season, Oregon State as a team has been outrushed by Oregon's LaMichael James, who has 1,285.
Tony La Russa managed the Cardinals for 16 seasons, and it's wrong to say that his teams didn't run. The Cardinals swiped 100 or more bases in five of his 16 seasons, with a high of 164 in 1997. But in recent seasons, the Cardinals had slowed down. Between 2007-2011, they averaged only 60 steals per season, with a success rate of 61 percent.
Brewing has become so successful, in fact, that Central Oregon Community College is looking at a pilot program to train students in the art and science of turning roasted hops into drinkable suds.

Last year, a large contingent of Timbers Army folks went up into the Coastal Range to help cut wood for a disadvantaged man to help keep him supplied throughout the year. It was then, when I actually saw Timber Joey wielding an axe, and showing others how to actually chop wood, that I realized these men aren't just some regular old Joes from off the street playing up as the "Timbers Mascot."
But the small mine would leave more than 22,000 acres of similar habitat in the area, BLM says. It would only minimally increase stream temperatures -- an estimated 6/100th of a degree -- in BLM's downscaled proposal.

The compromise package marks a milestone for Brown, whose sole focus since his unprecedented return to the governor's office in January for a third term has been to close the state's budget gap and put California on firmer financial footing. But the spending plan is significantly different from what he initially proposed, after GOP lawmakers refused to support a special election on taxes Brown had wanted.

Thirty days later, the city school system responded to The Sun’s request with batches of contracts and invoices that outlined about $500,000 in renovations that had taken place across eight departments. Close to half of them, not including the canceled purchases, belonged to the basement. The Sun has not received the canceled invoices, though the system stopped a $41,000 custom-made furniture order after The Sun inquired about the project, saving $37,000.

In 2002, New Jersey became the 15th state to use Amber Alerts. Although an alert was issued when a Passaic toddler was kidnapped by her uncle last April, they are generally not used for child custody disputes or in cases where family members abduct children.
As she was awakened that night by Terc standing over her, stabbing and beating her, the boyfriend awoke and tried to subdue Terc in a chokehold, an affidavit said. A desperate struggle ensued and spilled out of the house and onto the sidewalk. By the time it was over, the boyfriend had been stabbed 12 times — in the leg, shoulder, face and head.

Hundreds of activists across the U.S. joined the worldwide May Day protests on Tuesday, with Occupy Wall Street members in several cities leading demonstrations and in some cases clashing with police.
Excessive? Absolutely. But it's excess at an intimate scale - and besides, let's face it, excess is part of today's Napa every bit as much as a not-bad Merlot.
Although they will not say it publicly, in addition to enhancing trade, the United States wants to counterbalance China's growing economic weight in Asia, and Mexico wants to offset Brazil's clout in Latin America.
"No one - Democrat, Republican, or Independent - thinks the current system is working. We can all agree that it is unacceptable to have 11 million people living here illegally, outside the system. . . . The time for playing politics with our immigration system is over. The American people, and now the President, have called on Congress to act. We cannot wait any longer: Congress must pass comprehensive immigration reform now."
Not so, according to the county's parks director, Lindsey Swanick.
"You would never get away with talking about your alcohol abuse the night before if this was a mainstream class," Chaifetz says in the YouTube video (below). "And that's the point, isn't it? They knew none of those boys could go home and tell their parents that the person who ran that class was under the influence of alcohol and was throwing up."
Buster Posey knows the day will come when he again has to step toward the third-base line, see a charging runner trying to score and brace for a collision.
Now, though, the crowd — announced at 42,080, the largest in the building’s history, though there were more than a couple empty patches — had grown quiet and solemn. Michael Bourn, Atlanta’s leadoff hitter, worked Santana to a 3-and-1 count. A walk would break a scoreless tie and provide a sizable buzzkill. A bases-clearing gapper would effectively shut off the sun and darken the sky.
Also, they're scheduled to take up House Bill 4098, which would increase timber harvest in state forests. Republicans want this legislation as part of a jobs package.
IHSAA Commissioner Bobby Cox offered a proposal that would assign point values for winning a sectional (one point), regional (two), semistate (three) and state championship (four).

This is precisely what the St. Louis County Council and Metro's Board of Commissioners must do with the odor wafting from the transit agency's Meridian parking garage in Brentwood. It's not the 10-story garage itself that smells, but the deals that led to spending nearly $20 million on an overbuilt and underused parking garage.
"It's freeing," said Luciano, a domestic violence victim who declined to give her first name, during a ribbon-cutting ceremony on Wednesday. "It's like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. To move on and be on my own -- it's like doing it for the first time again, without the eggshells."
A woman checking on the Seneca Place house Friday night while a relative was away called police about 10:45 p.m. after she noticed light coming from the basement, looked into a window and saw a man inside, said Montclair police Lt. Scott Buehler.
Summer Reading is an incentive and theme-based reading program offered at all Enoch Pratt locations across Baltimore. Every year, more than 16,000 children and teens register for the reading program, and more than 30,000 participate in the free activities. The goal for registered participants is to read at least one book a week during the eight-week session. Through branch-based activities and performances — some of them featuring musicians and storytellers — the program is designed to help children build a love for reading, promote family reading and help students continue to learn over the summer.

"I can't pretend to speak for him, but per my last conversation with him a couple of weeks back, he indicated a lot of people were trying to push him toward re-election," Roberts said of Babeu. "But he indicated to me he had both feet in the water for his congressional campaign."
years. At this time, sexual activity is a determinant for some types of testing, including tests for chlamydia and gonorrhea as well as HIV screening. Teen girls should have their regular preventive vaccines and boosters, including the flu vaccine each year, and should discuss with their physician and parents whether to have the HPV vaccine, which prevents the virus that can cause cervical cancer later in life.

"Our aim is never to activate this mechanism ... that will discourage those who seek to take advantage of Greece's difficult position," Petalotis said Monday. "Our aim remains to finance our borrowing needs from the international markets."
In a police report, Goodkin described the group's actions this way: "While this activity started as a twisted adventure … fueled by celebrity worship, it quickly mushroomed into an organized criminal enterprise."
If Strickland has a long-term plan to grow jobs, it's clearly not yet working. Ohioans deserve to know what he'd do differently in that area during a second term -- and they have every right to demand the details of Kasich's plan, too.
Winston, Goodale’s star recruit from Jackson Memorial High, was Rutgers’ lone titlist at the Eastern Intercollegiate Wrestling Association Championships last weekend. After such an incredible scholastic career (137-0, three state titles), the pressure of carrying that over to college hasn’t affected him.
Hawaii Forest & Trail's Kona Coffee & Craters Tour: Kona is known for its coffee. But its landscape, which rises from the ocean to more than 6,000 feet above sea level in just a few short miles, is just as impressive. By taking this tour, you can get your arms around both. Explore barren volcanic landscape, peer into deep craters, examine the scraggly plant life that somehow manages to survive and even scramble through a lava tube or two. Then head to Mountain Thunder, a highly prized organic coffee farm and processor for an in-depth explanation of how coffee is grown and processed.
Staying in character: The finish materials in the reworked kitchen don't scream shiny and new. The cabinets are made of local quartersawn white oak; the island is granite with a leathered surface, and the countertops are honed black granite. "Nothing is polished. It looks like it's been there," Hansen said. Julie needed a little convincing when it came to the wood choice. "I kept saying, 'I don't want oak,'" she said. "I was picturing '80s oak," honey-colored and heavily grained. But after Hansen told her he intended to match the cabinets to an antique buffet the family already owned, Julie was convinced. "He showed me, and I said, 'That I like,'" she recalled. "He clearly had a vision for this kitchen."
Barna said O’Neill, who earns $210,000, is needed, not only because of his performance, but also because key administrative positions are vacant and someone needs to guide the district as it develops a new core group of administrators.
The ship had been destined for scrapping when the Japan earthquake struck, so there is no cargo on board, according to Webb. He said it’s likely there is little or no fuel on board because the ship has been traveling high in the water, indicating a light ballast.
“Obviously it means a lot to me. It means that things have been going well, but it also means I play for a club that’s given me the opportunity to play a lot. I have a pretty good team in front of me, as well.”
Before Zellers apologized, two of the Legislature's openly gay members, Rep. Karen Clark and Sen. Scott Dibble, both of Minneapolis, issued a statement denouncing Dean's prayer. Clark called him "a hateful person" and said his presence in the chamber was "reprehensible."
The company's financial woes have cast a shadow over the future of the event. Baltimore Racing Development is struggling to pay contractors, has missed a loan payment to the state and is under pressure to reorganize.

In Greenacres in central Palm Beach County, one resident got so fed up with the condition of the abandoned vermin-ridden duplex attached to hers, and the lack of response from Bank of America, the mortgage servicer, that she stuck a sign on its window last September that read: "House full of RATS & BANK don't care." The foreclosure case, filed on behalf of another bank, had been ongoing for two years by then.
For more than three decades, the Assembly's practice had been to withhold member budgets and not to release member-by-member expenditure data until 12 months after the legislative year had ended.
"Bevin is now stamping our dog-paw logo on the bells, and reinforces them so that they don't get squished when they are caught in the door," Pedersen said. "You wouldn't get that kind of service from a supplier in China, and we like the fact that it's all made right here in Connecticut. Matt is a role model for a lot of small companies like us because we're all trying to show that this kind of thing can still survive in America and be innovative, and that's what he's doing."
Well, you can't blame him; she looks great in a bra and thong.
We have a massive candor gap, led by President Barack Obama but also implicating most leaders of both parties. The annual budget necessarily involves a bewildering blizzard of numbers. But just a few figures capture the essence of our predicament.
International human-rights groups and some athletes' organizations have expressed concern over the ability of participants and spectators to speak freely during the Games. In April, International Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge said that "freedom of expression is something that is absolute" and is shared by athletes.

Schumaker pinch hit for reliever Mitchell Boggs after Shane Robinson walked. Schumaker drove his hit to right-center field, advancing Robinson to third base. Robinson then scored on shortstop Rafael Furcal's third hit of the game for a 4-1 lead.
A shooting in our city shouldn't be cause for retreat or blame. To the contrary, it ought to awaken within us a deeper resolve to reclaim our city as a place of civility, culture, commerce and faith. Those who abandon her for the suburbs or grumble with reproach about her dangers, as did the person who commented online, "War combat zone. Stay out of Cleveland war zone, all of Cleveland" in response to Michael Sangiacomo's June 3 article in The Plain Dealer, are not only out of touch with the strength the core brings to the entire region, or the growing downtown neighborhood -- 10,000 residents strong and representing the city's highest per capita income and level of education -- they are also part of the problem in that they perpetuate a myth that crime is unique to downtown or that you will be safe if you avoid downtown.
Parker, ranked as the 20th-best high school player in the nation by Scout.com, averaged 16.6 points and 11.0 rebounds to lead Miller Grove to the state title. He averaged 18 points and 13 rebounds and won four state titles during his high school career.

As far back as humans can remember, it was always one of the duties of one generation to educate the next one, going back to when education consisted mostly of explaining that the herd should be watered downstream from the camp, not upstream. (Still the greatest public health breakthrough in history.) But then, starting a few decades ago, the generation that first discovered spray-can cheese came up with a new vision: Bill the next generation for its own education.

According to a Tribune/WGN-TV poll conducted March 7-9, 42 percent of Illinois voters described themselves as born-again or evangelical Christians. Of that group, 42 percent backed Santorum, compared with 26 percent for former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, who is Mormon. Of the 54 percent of voters who do not consider themselves born-again or evangelical Christians, Romney led Santorum, 43 percent to 22 percent. The poll did not give voters the option to identify as Catholic.
The Château Ducasse is a bit more refined, a little softer and a tad lighter in body than the Mouton Cadet. Also, the label states that the wine was bottled at the château where the grapes were grown. This white Bordeaux has a 12 percent level of alcohol and is made from 60 percent sémillon, 35 percent sauvignon blanc and 5 percent muscadelle. It is a crisp, aromatic wine that tastes of peaches with a hint of grapefruit and mineral. The sémillon tames the herbaceousness of the sauvignon blanc, while the sauvignon blanc lends good acidity.

During her quest, Mavis runs into schlubby Matt Freehauer (Patton Oswalt), whose locker was next to hers in high school, but whom she only remembers as the guy beaten to a pulp by gay-bashing jocks. The resulting permanent injuries — he walks laboriously with a crutch, never mind about his private parts — have made Matt as twisted as Mavis. An unlikely alliance forms.

Both villages possess fairly long histories. Lakeline was incorporated in 1929 and the Village of Timberlake was established in 1947. Like so may Lake County shoreline communities, the two villages experienced their first significant development when city dwellers began to seek refuge from urban Cleveland.

Born and raised on a farm in Aurora, she was a seamstress and a devout Catholic who prayed the Novena every night.
The governor also emphasizes that his proposal is important to public safety, and it is — indirectly. At Brown's urging, the Legislature agreed last year to shift responsibility for certain types of felons from the state to county criminal justice systems. The initiative would amend the state Constitution to guarantee that local governments receive funding from state sales, use and vehicle taxes for those new duties, rather than leaving it up to the annual budget process. Without that kind of assurance, counties could find themselves with a diminishing amount of state aid to handle the felons left on their doorstep, increasing the risk of earlier releases from custody with less supervision.
"It looks to me like there will be rough parity in spending between the parties," he said. "But there's no way on earth any (Democratic) candidate is going to close the gap" in personal fundraising given Walker's commanding financial advantage.

Wesley Matthews, who stands to be impacted by Crawford’s addition as much as anyone on the Blazers’ roster, reached out to the free agent guard on Twitter Wednesday night and the two ended up talking at length on the phone. Throughout their conversation, Matthews lobbied hard for Crawford to sign with the Blazers while Crawford peppered Matthews with questions.
Modifying the MHSAA's constitution requires a two-thirds vote of the superintendents and principals, so Dompierre needs the MHSAA to put this proposal on a statewide ballot, which it refused to do at last year's meeting.
There'll always be plenty of George Bushes and John Kerrys to go around; the Crips and the Bloods will trot them out every four years whether we like it or not. But a voice in the wilderness, like the still, small voice within, is a song to be savored while we have it, whether we're listening or not, and when we have lost it, we should mourn for ourselves. Such a voice was that of Molly Ivins.
For an encore, Stile Antico offered the simple harmonies of Thomas Campion’s “Never Weather-beaten Sail.”

“Now we want to step it up a level,” he said. For example, before an event, such as Music on Main Street, the fireworks display, the Green Fair or a craft fair, the borough will be able to send an announcement to everyone on its list, whether they like to get their information via email, Facebook or Twitter.
The groups do give you a hint on how things work, and how the manager wants some players to interact. One corner of today's schedule, for example, outlines the fielders who will be working together with coach Jose Oquendo. This gives you a sense of a line in the clubhouse the splits between the major-league regulars and minor-leaguers in major-league camp.
"If I have a 13-year-old being harassed via text, I can't call and get those texts. This bill will allow me to at least pay to see the text messages for my children,” the Republican lawmaker told the paper.

Marine debris is trash that is found in the ocean or along our beaches. It's basically anything that is foreign to the marine ecosystem, something that mother nature never intended. It was the dumping of debris into the harbor that started all the conflict in the book Flush. There are two major factors that effect what debris will end up in the ocean -- buoyancy and whether an item can be carried by the wind.
"If there was no Adele or Norah, what would they play in coffee shops and hotels?" one prominent jazz musician playfully asked on Twitter last month, pairing two runaway Grammy winners of the last 10 years.

But how many Americans woke up on Wednesday thinking Mr. Santorum will now go on to face President Barack Obama this fall? Surely the most shocked by the results in Iowa must be the voters of Pennsylvania who kicked Mr. Santorum out of the U.S. Senate six years ago. Polls conducted over the past two months show him trailing both Mr. Romney and Mr. Gingrich for the GOP nomination in his own state. What does that say about him?
Another fundraising veteran said the most successful raffle he's seen is "Money to Burn," where you buy a fire pit and fill it with $100 or so in lottery tickets and toss in marshmallows, hot dog buns and other fun items. The cleverness makes it an easy-to-sell ticket.

It certainly is a powerful story. The El Sol Academy, established in 2001 as a preschool-through-eighth grade publicly chartered school, whose purpose is to provide its primarily low-income population an education, today serves more than 600 students and has risen from low-performing ranks to one of the top five performing schools in Santa Ana. With a 2009 Academic Performance Index score of 843 out of 1,000, the school also received the California Distinguished School designation. “These are well-rounded kids who are exploring all of their talents, and they will be able to make positive, informed choices for the rest of their lives. That’s what we’re preparing them for,” stated El Sol Academy Executive Director Monique Daviss at the High Hopes Luncheon, launched in partnership with Children First, a Merage Foundation, the Children & Families Commission of Orange County and the Orange County Community Foundation.
Coburn offered his thoughts at the Senate Judiciary Committee meeting this month to consider Arizona Supreme Court Justice Andrew D. Hurwitz's nomination to the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. That hearing started in typical fashion, with the chairman, Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) and the ranking member, Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa), exchanging pleasantries. Grassley then announced his intention to vote against Hurwitz. His "primary concern" was a 2002 law review article "embracing and celebrating the framework for Roe vs. Wade" that Hurwitz wrote. The senator also remarked that President Obama's allegedly unconstitutional recess appointments of officials in January required him to apply a less deferential standard that Hurwitz could not satisfy.
There is much to learn about the unprecedented primary vote and victory of Proposition 13. Not the least of which is that the established political union, and corporate powers are no match for an angry citizenry recoiling against an inflationary threat to their homes and pocketbooks.

Expanding access to charter schools is one of Gov. Chris Christie’s education reform priorities, but this application cycle drew 10 fewer applicants than the last round in October. School leaders will learn by September if their plans have been approved.
The camera took great shots in bright and low light, and I had fun playing with the different settings, which range from simple color filters to light sensitivity and image sharpness options. The digital zoom wasn't that impressive, as it seemed to blur photos. There is plenty of space to store the photos you do like, though, as the phone includes 32 gigabytes of internal memory. There's also a microSD memory card slot for adding more. If money is no object and you're looking for a handset that can do a bit of everything, this may be the one.
Like a musical chair tossed through a juke joint window, Church shook up the sell-out crowd at the Chaifetz Arena and offered one of the most flat-out fun concerts I've attended in a couple of years.
As gifted as its actors are — perhaps because they are — “Blue Valentine” is a fairly depressing proposition. It’s not giving anything away to say that this is not a film that ends with a stammered public apology and a final embrace as a pop song plays and the end credits role. (If someone suggests this as a date movie, be warned.)
"If I say something, is it really going to make national news?" said Parker, who has been critical of the authorities' handling of the Martin case. The Cavaliers shooting guard is thrilled two of the NBA's biggest stars have used their platforms to inject themselves into the controversy.

The gradually increasing realization among much of humanity that the myths told by priests, rabbis and imams for millennia are just that -- myths -- has forced "us" to confront difficult and troubling questions about morality and the meaning of life. That we should strive to be more compassionate, to have a broader perspective, to experience more awe, is unassailably true. It's also true that religion, in its finest moments, has helped people do so. But to make the leap that, therefore, it is the methods of religion that are the only way to continue the quest for existential meaning, borders on the absurd.
When the left rear tire of the trailer blew out, Miner braked suddenly and lost control of his motorcycle, which overturned onto its left side, ejecting Miner, troopers said.

Excitement stirred the hot, humid English summer air. Black capes swung from small shoulders, tall pointed black hats sat on little heads, and round black spectacles perched on miniature noses.
Many in attendance didn’t speak, ceding the floor instead to council regulars or known Republicans or Democrats. Those who did comment traditionally fell into two camps: those who cautioned council to let Bencivengo’s legal troubles wind their way through court and those who called on the governing body to order the mayor to resign or suffer the consequences.

Corruption's rampant. No one gives a fig about taxpayers.
Finally, the ad criticizes Romney for proposing a new approach to corporate income taxes, one that looks at profits made just in the United States. Such a "territorial" approach happens to be the one used in almost every other developed country. Today the United States taxes multinational companies on all the profits they make globally, but does not collect the tax on foreign earnings until they are brought back into the United States. This system may discourage companies from putting assets and jobs in low-tax foreign lands simply for the sake of cutting their tax bills, but it isn't an effective deterrent. Instead, it makes it harder for companies to take the profits they make in expanding foreign markets and reinvest them in their U.S. operations.

This wasn't Young's first suspension. In 2006, he was given a 50-game ban by the International League for throwing a bat that hit a replacement umpire in the chest.
Sure, there were a couple times I wish Aikman and Buck had discussed strategy a little more, such as why Green Bay chose to kick off after winning the coin toss (which worked out) or why Pittsburgh coach Mike Tomlin asked his notoriously shaky kicker to try a 52-yard field goal (which didn't). But those instances were rare.
As bordering states, Oregon and Washington think a lot about comparative business and tax advantages and disadvantages. For example, business owners in Clark County rightly worry that people shop south of the border to save money on sales tax. And Oregonians now have to worry that Washington's new liquor law soon will have people in the Portland area and beyond heading north to stock up on booze.

“I have no period of music where I feel more at ease. There are strong personalities and beautiful composers in all times who talk about the human heart and our struggles.”
That logic was flawed, of course. The Royals (or any other MLB team) have never shared the rights to New Jersey the way that the A's once shared rights to San Jose and Santa Clara County. Also, the Yankees did in fact permit the Mets to become New York City neighbors as an expansion team in 1962. Danger was avoided. No lives were lost.

If that sounds haunting, wait till you get to the coast. As you get closer, the sand turns from yellow to a lunar sort of gray. The shore here, infamous among mariners for five centuries, is often wreathed in treacherous fog. Farther north, where it's known as the Skeleton Coast, the whitewashed ribs of old shipwrecks still appear, half-buried in storm-shifted sands.

This pub brings a bit of the Irish to Westgate, offering Irish-American fare and a full bar. But this place isn't a laid-back pub, because it gets packed with rowdy, dancing partiers every weekend. McFadden's is next to Jobing.com Arena and University of Phoenix Stadium, making it easy to stop by before a concert or after the game. This place offers happy hour, DJ music and 40 plasma TVs for watching the game.

While there are larger homes on the Whitefish Chain, disgraced car dealer Denny Hecker's 10,000-square-foot lakefront house may be the most infamous.

Yes, the 1983 law has promoted labor peace in Ohio's public sector. The question is whether the cost has been too steep. The status quo, especially in school-union bargaining, just invites taxpayer revolts. Still, the watchwords in this Statehouse collective bargaining debate should be, "Mend -- don't end."
Thursday's budget presentation was the first under a consent agreement with the state that avoided the appointment of an emergency manager to run the city. A manager could have stripped the mayor and the council of much of their authority, imposed drastic budget cuts and gutted union contracts. Last week, Gov.

Romney pronounced himself appalled, accusing Obama of having "railed against arguments no one is making" and "criticized policies no one is proposing." Yet Romney could neither defend the cuts nor deny the president's list of particulars, based as they were on reasonable assumptions. And when Obama went after the right's willingness to use the power of the Supreme Court for ideological purposes, conservatives were aghast - and never mind that conservatives have been castigating activist judges since at least the 1968 presidential campaign.

I've never quite understood why airlines or online travel agencies issue vouchers that expire. It makes sense from a company's point of view - after all, you don't want a lot of outstanding IOUs floating around out there - but why do customers put up with it? I mean, do we allow our money to expire?

A. A valuable piece of advice he says he learned was having a healthy appetite for risk. Coming from the accounting background, Filley tended to have a more conservative view toward risk. He learned that as a leader, it was important for him to find the right balance between being risk-averse and risk-seeking. To "win" you really must learn to place "bets," take prudent risks and play "offense;" especially during difficult economic times.

Can you imagine if Tebow were doing in Jacksonville what he is now doing in Denver? They would have already taken the tarps of all those empty seats and filled the stadium. The Jaguars have been irrelevant for more than a decade — and Tebow would have made them relevant again.

The national anthem touts our nation as the "land of the free" and politicians define us as "freedom-loving." Indeed, the term "freedom" most aptly describes who we claim to be, doesn't it? It would seem, then, that Americans should be the experts on this topic. Not a week goes by that we don't hear someone praising those who lost their lives to preserve the freedoms we are told we cherish. But, do we? I challenge you to turn to your coffee-klatch buddies and seriously discuss what it means to you. You may find the answer more elusive than you think.

My friend Steven was diagnosed 11 years ago with ALS — Lou Gehrig's Disease. If you don't know what that is, the short version is that it is a gradual deterioration of the muscular nervous system. As such, it is a particularly evil disease — ALS eventually leads to paralysis, loss of bodily function control, and then, as the muscles that control breathing and swallowing fail, death. All while leaving the mind perfectly intact.

Gabbert should be impressive at the Combine. So unless Ryan Mallett or Jake Locker just put up crazy numbers there, I think Gabbert has a very good chance of being the No. 1 quarterback taken.

One series of studies from Canadian researchers concluded that heavily cushioned shoes were more likely to cause injury than simpler shoes. They also concluded that more expensive athletic shoes accounted for twice as many injuries as cheaper shoes. The data aren't conclusive.

That’s never been an approach that (owner) Paul Allen or this organization has taken.”

"We know that patients with co-morbid physical and mental health conditions are at particularly high risk for a shortened lifespan, a sedentary lifestyle and alcohol use. They also are at risk for high health expenditures because they are hospitalized or use the emergency room often," said Shenkman, who also serves as chairwoman of the UF College of Medicine department of health outcomes and policy. "Some of these folks have conditions such as asthma, diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease combined with depression or other mental health problems. The improved healthy lifestyle can help people better manage their physical health conditions and also have a positive effect on their mental health."
"I think the holdup is really our lack of understanding of female sexuality and applying this greater complexity to how we're studying potential treatments," says Clayton. "For women, a lot of our sexuality is above the neck, not below the waist," she says, which could explain why Viagra failed to produce results when tested in females. Viagra helps men with their most typical sexual problem--the inability to achieve and maintain an erection during sex--by causing blood to pool where it's needed. But female sex problems are more complicated and can be caused by a combination of hormonal, psychological, and interpersonal factors.
Revival of a Play: “Arthur Miller’s Death of a Salesman,” “Gore Vidal’s The Best Man,” “Tennessee Williams’ A Street car Named Desire” and “Margaret Edson’s Wit.” (One day I hope we’ll see a revival of “Arthur Bicknell’s Moose Murders.”)

Mr. Bo and Ms. Gu invited several of the Americans who had worked on the case, along with their families, to visit Dalian. The Bo family hosted them at the "Golden Pebble Beach" golf resort near Dalian, recalled one of the Americans, Robert Schenkein, then a public-relations consultant in Colorado, who had advised Ms. Gu during the case. The guests stayed in two-story New England-style cottages, each with two or three bedrooms.
"But I did not realize when we were in high school the value of long snapping," said Musso, who followed Hodel's career at the University of Illinois where he played football and baseball as a freshman but only football in his final three years while long snapping for punts, extra points and field goals.

Dwek, in setting up Fish and others, repeatedly told them that he was looking to pull cash out of his bankrupt real estate empire and from a "schnookie" bank deal gone bad. Later, he claimed he had profits he was trying to hide coming out of a counterfeit, high-end designer handbag business.
Kelly has 30 days to figure this out. He must scout, and prepare, and arrive in Pasadena with his team peaking. His players must stop believing that simply winning their conference is the ultimate goal of a top program, and break through the glass ceiling the Ducks have slammed their noses into the past two seasons.
Age-related changes to taste and smell occur gradually over time, and there's no way to reverse those changes. In some cases, however, loss of taste and smell may not be a product of aging alone. Nasal and sinus problems — such as nasal polyps, allergies or sinusitis — can lead to a decrease in these senses. Dental issues, including an abscess, tooth decay or poor dental hygiene, may also interfere with your ability to taste and smell. Cigarette smoking is another common cause for a decrease in taste and smell.
According to the report, she told police McCracken recently began to behave erratically and appeared "disconnected from reality."

Being overweight or obese has long been tied to an increased risk of several types of cancer, including cancers of the colon, esophagus, kidney, pancreas and -- in postmenopausal women -- breast. But there hadn't been much evidence on the effects of diet and exercise for cancer survivors.
Outside the home Wednesday, there was no indication of what had occurred inside. There was no crime-scene tape - only a newspaper in the driveway behind two vehicles, one a red Ford Explorer with a license plate that said "It shouldn't hurt to be a child."

Bonnie Smith, whose son Chris was on the voyage, said: "It means so much to families like ours to know that people care. We do not live typical lives and find even the most ordinary tasks to be challenging sometimes. Fish for Life looked beyond the obstacles to see the value in the experience, and expanded the horizons of so many in the process."

The Question: I'm refinancing my house and recently obtained my credit scores. While my scores are high, each reporting agency indicated that the number of open credit accounts affected my rating.
But, Portman added, "I think that's healthy for us to have conversations among ourselves. "There will be individual conversations. I'm sure there will be groups of senators and groups of members of the House who will be speaking periodically. So I think there needs to be a good balance here where people have input, people feel like it's a transparent process, but we also are able to have a candid exchange with colleagues."

This is not to say that Junior Seau is Duerson, that somehow they are the same because they were football players and their lives took them to these lonely and brutal deaths. No one could ever say that with certainty, even if their lives brought them to this kind of moment with a gun.

By the time the first quarter had ended, the Blazers led 27-19 and Wallace had his best quarter of the series: 13 points and six rebounds on 5 of 7 shooting. After struggling to find his niche and "rhythm" through five playoffs games, Wallace rediscovered the relentless game he revealed as a vital player at the end of the regular season.

Good weather often helps airlines avoid delays. In April there were long stretches when most of the nation was free of severe weather, according to the National Weather Service. Improvements in the efficient use of New York airspace likely also helped more flights takeoff and land on-time. About a third of all air traffic in the U.S. goes through the New York area, and delays here can ripple across the country.
It won't be easy. Students ralled en masse in support of Paterno, whose 409 victories made him the winningest major-college football coach in history and made him an idol on campus. Hopefully the students will soon recognize they were supporting the wrong person.
His problem now was that he was shoeless, and his only clothes — underwear really — had been ripped by the EMTs in the ambulance when they tried to check his body for injuries. From the hospital’s special closet of secondhand clothes, a nurse picked out a pair of pants, T-shirt and sneakers. A young woman with the Coast Guard offered him a sweater and blue jacket, then drove him home to Wildwood.
This year, though, Djokovic is 5-0 against Nadal, with all of those matches coming in tournament finals, most recently at Wimbledon. That allowed Djokovic to overtake Nadal in the rankings in July.

— Ashton Kutcher, to his Twitter fans after they turned on him when Kutcher tweeted his outrage over the firing of Penn State coach Joe Paterno. Kutcher quickly acknowledged that he hadn’t known anything about Paterno’s role in the alleged cover-up of sex abuse by a former assistant coach and apologized. Properly manage this feed? We old-timers call it thinking before speaking. You're not grousing to your roommate about something you overhead while working out at the gym. You're talking to eight million people.

No, I responded. He could not.
Some people fighting to save Hagedorn include vocal opponents to New Jersey’s reliance on housing patients in institutions. Last spring, the state chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness noted its “strong opposition” to shuttering a facility “with a very positive reputation” for caring for geriatric patients.
Figs must not only grow well here but ripen their fruit, too. Some figs are capable of ripening two crops per year here, others just one. The fruit may be red, purple, brown, green, yellow-green, yellow or nearly black. Leaf sizes and shapes can vary a lot. I think some figs are best eaten fresh, while others are best dried or made into jam.
Dining at Wolfgang's, I feel as if I'm in a time warp. With its bluster, bonhomie and fawning service, and the pianist belting out stale standards, the place seems left over from the Rat Pack era. Except instead of vodka martinis, deep-pocketed revelers are drinking cult California Cabernets.

But city leaders say they are running out of time and options to forestall a crippling financial meltdown. Without a solution soon the city will be forced to levy a 30 percent tax increase. Even with the "lease-back" revenue, Newark is facing a possible 20 percent property tax hike and more than 600 layoffs.
At Hale Arena
The arrangements on Gil Scott-Heron's early recordings were consistent with the conventions of jazz poetry -- the movement that sought to bring the spontaneity of live performance to the reading of verse. Jack Kerouac and other Beat poets, for instance, often read while accompanied by percussionists. But it was Langston Hughes, the star of the Harlem Renaissance of the '20, who exerted the most profound influence over Heron, and it is not an exaggeration to see Heron as Hughes' direct successor. Like Hughes, Scott-Heron was fiercely proud to be black, and forged his cadences from centuries of African-American traditions; like Hughes, he took as his great subject the everyday struggles of the poor and dispossessed. Langston Hughes never feared controversy; nor did Gil Scott-Heron.
For example, two city pension agencies, departments whose boards have a majority of their members appointed by Villaraigosa, have committed up to $50 million to CityView, a real estate fund headed by Henry Cisneros, a Cabinet secretary in the Clinton administration.

Chuck Klosterman, ESPN.com: "Calipari has professionalized college sports, which is great for him and good for his recruits. It's just discomforting for anyone who likes NCAA basketball, assuming they're drawn to the same game that lives within their memory. He's built awesome teams for seven consecutive seasons, usually by overhauling his entire roster with transitory superstars who are only attending college because there's no reasonable alternative. He's completely up-front about this strategy, and it's irrefutably effective. In his three years at Kentucky, he's never lost a home game. But here's the rub: Every season, something goes wrong at the end - and that validates his critics . . . It's like there's this indefinable weakness to his system that everyone hopes will eventually emerge; somehow, we want to believe that the way Calipari conducts business is intangibly doomed (because that reinforces the traditional view of what team sports are supposed to represent). It's not unlike the way most NBA observers are predisposed to root against the Miami Heat: You should not be able to succeed in this way. You should not be able to arbitrarily construct a Super Team that automatically achieves Super Greatness. It cheapens the experience. It feels cold and uncreative. That's why traditionalists are always relieved when Calipari's template collapses: It suggests there's some inherent flaw to his philosophy that even he cannot see. It balances the system. But not this time."
Two members of the Legislative Youth Advisory Council briefly spoke in support of the bill. No one testified against it. The measure could come up for a committee vote later this week.
Unlike a good many of his fellow designers, he is modest, soft-spoken and rather uncomfortable in the spotlight. He is not the sort to host trunk shows in big department stores, walk the red carpet or pal around with celebrities. He rises at 5 a.m. and works quietly and diligently, overseeing everything from design to the tissue paper that his clothing will be sold in. Van Noten spends his evenings dining at stylish local restaurants, such as Hofstraat 24—run by his friends, chef Roman Drowart and Laurence Van Bree—or at home. He shares a 19th-century manor with beautiful grounds outside of Antwerp with his business and life partner of 25 years, Patrick Vangheluwe, and their two-year-old Airedale, Harry. "It's a busy job, what we have here," Van Noten admits. "But we try to enjoy all three—fashion, house and garden—every day."

The favorite So You Think and last year's runner-up Transcend grabbed the early lead out of the gate. The Bill Mott-trained filly Royal Delta joined the leaders only to fade, as did Game On Dude ridden by Chantal Sutherland, who made history as the first female jockey in the race, held in the United Arab Emirates. Transcend also dropped back, finishing last.
IT'S A MADD, MADD WORLD ...
Williams first went to trial in 2004, and a jury acquitted him of aggravated manslaughter, the most serious offense. He was convicted of the four charges related to the cover-up. Reckless manslaughter was the only charge on which jurors could not agree. He was slated to be retried this year, but pleaded guilty Jan. 11. During that hearing, Williams admitted that he pulled a shotgun from his gun collection on Feb. 14, 2002. He failed to check whether the safety mechanism was on, or if the gun was loaded, and he didn’t pay attention to where the muzzle was pointed. When he snapped the gun shut, it discharged and hit Christofi in the chest.

Mesenchymal stem cells, or MSCs, are found in the bone marrow. More than 150 other clinical trials in the United States and around the world are currently testing MSCs' ability to encourage tissue repair as a way to treat a variety of other conditions such as osteoarthritis, diabetes, emphysema and stroke. Stem cell therapy is already used to treat leukemia, lymphoma and certain blood disorders.

A: We did it in 17 days. I would never do that again; it was very difficult. There's nothing in there that we kept. Some light fixtures and an oven, but other than that, we replaced everything. Brand-new equipment. We painted everything, resurfaced everything, extended the bar, did a lot of things in 17 days.

Newt Gingrich won in his home state of Georgia.
The play is fast, inventive, creative and very, very funny. It resembles the book in that it roughly follows the plot and has all the same characters -- but what Rick Elice has done is reinvent it all, and the two directors have realized his words and story into this constantly moving, uproariously funny two hours of magic. You leave the theater enchanted, and that is the most anyone (especially the authors) could ever ask for.
And Marion County had the lowest grade of any local community -- a D-minus -- on the educational attainment and achievement of its residents.

“That’ll get you a gelato in Rome or maybe a pastry in Paris, if you’re lucky,” Mack said, then laughed. “It won’t get you too far. I suppose if you were couch surfing and eating street food and not going to any museums you could scrape by.”
On this night, they will get a necessary history lesson, even if Broadway is an unlikely source. They will find out what most of us oldsters know, that the NBA was a drug-ravaged, troubled league before Larry Bird and Magic Johnson brought college basketball into the light in 1979 and then put pro basketball on the marquee when they began in '80. Bird's Boston Celtics and Johnson's Los Angeles Lakers met in the NBA Finals three times in a four-year span in the '80s, the Lakers winning twice.
The regime clearly hopes to use the Arab League’s mission as a diversion from demands for United Nations intervention.
The softball team dropped seven of eight games before going 8-3 to raise its record to 22-20. Freshman outfielder Brianna Butler (Triad) continues to be the most consistent offensive threat. The daughter of former Triad girls basketball, baseball and softball coach Darrell Butler leads the Tritons in hitting (.414). She and junior infielder-pitcher Leslie Davis (Piasa Southwestern) are tied for the team lead with eight home runs, and Butler tops the Tritons with 37 RBI. UMSL has hit 40 home runs and is making a run at the school record of 59 hit in 2010. The Tritons are 32nd in the nation in home runs among Division II schools.

Question: In January, my husband and I flew to Rio de Janeiro from LAX, as we have done many times. But this time, something unusual happened. We had never had jet lag like this before, and we had it at both ends of the trip. If it had been just one of us, I might have thought one of us was coming down with something. The fact that it happened to both of us, both ways, same symptoms, makes me wonder whether they might be pressurizing the plane differently. Is it possible that caused our jet lag?
Arizona could be particularly interesting because the Cardinals have some playmakers (including an All-Pro receiver), they play in a dome, and their division is winnable even with the resurgence of the 49ers. Miami is appealing in part because Dolphins owner Stephen Ross might step up in a big way to land a star, but that's a very tough division with each of the other three teams playing outdoors in cold-weather cities.
They’ll be ready soon, most likely early next month — ready for the moment when all the state’s air conditioners are at full blast, and in the immortal words of Captain Kirk from "Star Trek," "We need more power!"

Dan Rosensweig, chief executive of textbook rental service Chegg, said Kutcher occasionally visits the start-up's Santa Clara, Calif., headquarters, recently meeting with the product team for four hours. One Friday afternoon, Kutcher sent an email saying he had spent a couple of hours on the site and had put together a lengthy "series of notes" on his ideas for improvements.
The idea that Oregon has a functioning capital punishment system is one of our comforting delusions, along with the beliefs that having the shortest school year in the country isn't really a problem, and that we have a citizen legislature. But when the only criminals Oregon executes are those who ask to be executed, and when dozens of prisoners on the state's death row have been there for decades with decades yet to go, it's not easy to believe.
Wearing a lavender dress shirt and khakis, he stood before the federal magistrate as the first person criminally charged in connection with the Deepwater Horizon disaster.
Mourdock has his supporters and detractors -- that is, people who will turn out Tuesday driven foremost by their desire to vote either for or against him. But such voters appear to be in the minority as this bitter and bemusing primary campaign reaches its final week. This race, it has become clear, is all about Lugar.
Earlier this year, the city of St. Louis banned smoking inside the terminals or concourses at Lambert-St. Louis International Airport. This summer, the airport sought and received clarification that the smoking ban covered e-cigarettes as well, said Lambert spokesman Jeff Lea.

Limited government also means effective government. When government takes on too many tasks, it usually doesn’t do any of them very well. It’s no coincidence that trust in government is at an all-time low now that the size of government is at an all-time high.
Some reactions from around the city of Portland and the basketball world to news of Brandon Roy's retirement:
Either the mitral or aortic valves can be replaced with metal or tissue valves. The advantage of a metal valve is long-term durability, making the need for surgery later on less likely.
In the meanwhile, Tavares sent out a reverse-911 call to city residents at 1:15 a.m. about the missing girl, and the county made a geographically wider call several hours later. In all, the phones in some 37,000 phones jangled during the night.

Those sandwiches! They're decadent, creative, diet-blowing delights, ordered off of vinyl record covers converted into menus and served in a funky restaurant-bar with a very rock 'n' roll vibe.

Both came with crispy hand-cut fries and sweet, peppery slaw.

Appel's family released a statement through the county:
The war is on. Ajla is a Bosnian Muslim, and over the coming weeks she and the other women in town are rounded up by Serbian soldiers and bused to a camp. On the way, the soldiers shoot a man on a sidewalk with casual disregard. The women are terrified, as they should be. When they arrive at the camp, the soldiers immediately make clear the situation the women find themselves in: The soldiers begin raping them, in public. A soldier grabs Ajla and is about to assault her when he's stopped -- by Danijel, who's the Serbian officer running the camp. Yes, a handy plot device and a bit of a stretch. But it's the setup for the remainder of the film.

His remarks lasted less than four minutes, with the final segment devoted to the elephant in the room.
Bryant nailed two step-back one-legged fadeaways that appeared similar to Dirk Nowitzki. It serves as another example of Bryant adding an extra nuance to his game each season, but he's hardly going to pay homage to someone who's won less rings than him.

Has really improved his patience and overall feel between the tackles from a year ago as well. Does a much better job picking his way through traffic, setting up blocks and than accelerating through daylight, as opposed to simply trying out sprit and run over any defender in his path. Lacks elite top end speed and isn't a guy who can simply outpace angles at the second level. However, is still a big play threat because of his ability to make defenders miss and break tackles at the second level. Is much more agile/sudden than given credit for and will catch the football out of the backfield as well. Has the frame and toughness to hold his own in blitz pick-up and is a guy who can play all three downs in the NFL.

At the film's start, life is lovey-dovey for Tom and Violet. Soon after Tom cutely pops the question, things fall apart thanks to a string of unexpected events. A rushed wedding between Violet's quirky sister Suzie ("Community's" Alison Brie) and Tom's crass chef buddy Alex (a scene-stealing Chris Pratt of "Parks and Recreation"), along with a postdoc gig for Violet at the University of Michigan put engagement plans on ice. Their move to Michigan chills their relationship, with Tom quietly sacrificing his career so Violet can pursue her academic dream.

The United States is among the few modern economies in the world that still circulate such a low-denomination paper currency. Today's dollar buys about as much as a quarter did in the 1970s. In Canada, the lowest paper currency is the $5 bill, and in Japan it's the 5 yen ($12). And yet, year after year, the U.S. government churns out billions of $1 bills to replace the billions of worn-out dollars that are shredded and dumped in landfills -- at your expense. Dollar coins, meanwhile, are virtually indestructible, fully recyclable, and have a lifespan of 30 or more years. It's simply a better, more efficient product.

Included among their songs will be an original arrangement of Robert Frost's "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening." Twenty singers all (including bass Emmanuel Williams), the Seaside Singers are under the baton of founder and singer Judy Tugendreich. The choir got their start in Pacifica and have lived by these simple rules since day one — have a previous background of singing in a church or school choir, have a basic knowledge of how music works (notation, rhythm and so on), know how to blend your voice, have a real love of a beautiful choral sound, be willing to take on the challenge of hard work and enjoy the camaraderie that comes with all of this. Anyone who has ever heard the Seaside Singers sing, for instance at their annual Pacifica Performances "Festival of Holiday Music," their Pacifica Performances Spring Concert, or perhaps just recently at the Pacifica Pier Poetry Walk, knows this is a choral group that got their wish — lovely artistry melding in beautiful voices, plus they are a hoot!

which tries to offer dirt-cheap fares and hits customers with lots of add-on fees for everything from soft drinks to window seats, added a fee for carry-on bags that go in overhead bins last year. That drew the wrath of travelers and several members of Congress. But Spirit says the fee removes the financial incentive for passengers to avoid checking bags by loading up on carry-ons. Carry-ons can cost as much as $40 each way, more expensive than Spirit's checked-bag fee, which starts at $28 and goes as high as $38, depending on how and when you pay it.

Let me say right now I support, and have nothing against the organized, and Missouri Water Patrol Permitted events. It is the unsafe unorganized over 100 mph activities that endangers others lives, and property that many of us have a problem with.

Orchid Grill & Kabob, co-owned by Abbas and Sarah Mohammadi (who are also co-chefs), has been in the same Tarzana strip mall for 17 years, but it's slowly grown from a tiny stall to full-sized restaurant. It's been doing business for nine months since the last expansion. The newest incarnation is bright and open and cheerful, with big windows and an enormous steam table for lunch buffets. Family members seem to be constantly wandering in and out of the kitchen. It can feel like you've been sucked into an Iranian family party.
U.S. Reps. Steve LaTourette and Marcia Fudge have an even bigger idea: a $4 billion federal bond fund for demolition; especially hard-hit areas would be eligible for extra money. Communities trying to recover from the abandonment plague need lots of help, and the bipartisan duo have come up with a clever way to provide it. Congress should move quickly to enact their idea.

They've got the recipe. Peyton's a great player, they've got a great offense and they're great at taking what the defense gives them."
A: It sounds like your plant was frozen and you now have the remaining stem growing. I would take special care, water and fertilize, and give it another growing season to determine viability. We also had an extreme summer. It may respond and become a lime "tree" again. It's worth trying.

“Yeah, it was a tough and trying time. Looking back I remember having a severe concussion early in my career when I was 21 years old and it took me almost a year to bounce back from that. I don’t know if that had anything to do, but after the concussion this year I went into a lull for almost two months. If it’s the case or not... Was I just bad? I don’t know exactly. When the playoffs started, for me, it was a chance for a new season. You erase everything that happened before and you can’t even look back on anything that’s happened before in your career. It’s a new season, you start it new and you try to help pout your team as much as possible. I was able to get a couple breaks in the first game in Pittsburgh and after that things kind of got rolling.”

The Knicks were said to be close to a deal with Smith at press time. They had an experienced man in position, I guess. The Clippers only had promises.

Furthermore, the average Zambian citizen can carry more on their heads, their backs and their bicycles than we can stash in our SUV trunks. I don't know where they were all going, but the roads we traveled on were busy with pedestrians and bicyclists at all hours of the day. A simple toot of the horn warned them to move over. They'd probably shake their heads in confusion if they heard about our local motorist versus bicyclist issues.

For a model, he had been looking for an older man whose face would somehow express patriotism. In Costco on a lunch break, he spied Barthule, wearing a "USA" cap. He snapped a photo but didn't get the shopper's name -- it never occurred to Bauman that he'd win the contest.
Q: What would the compact do?
"I'm sure they've been waiting to do that for years," Lindley said.
I can understand inner-city legislators desperately seizing on charter schools as a possible solution; but why are legislators from affluent suburban districts jumping on the voucher-charter school bandwagon? Why did state Sen. Jane Cunningham, R-7th District, of Chesterfield, sponsor a bill forcing school districts to accept transfer students and expanding charter schools statewide? Why did state Rep. Cole McNary, R-86th District, of Chesterfield, sponsor amendments to allow taxpayer-funded vouchers for transfers to private and parochial schools?

We might get a taste of how Knight's proposed rule change would affect college basketball if the seemingly inevitable NBA lockout after the present season dissuades the top college freshmen from entering the draft. Ohio State's Jared Sullinger has already said he will stay in school. The labor uncertainty also might affect North Carolina's Harrison Barnes and UConn's Jeremy Lamb.

If, thanks be to the heavens, you get a date or a boyfriend, you will become an even busier pet mama. Presumably, any man who wants to share life with you is a man who likes dogs. And you may find your responsibility is shared by someone who is glad to help you wrangle your threesome. Wouldn't that be nice?
"He will do well. What's in place right now, what started with Art Briles and was built on by Kevin Sumlin, tells you that things are moving forward. We've been able to win a lot of games, and Tony will keep winning."
He simply is a limited player. He cannot make the plays with any regularity needed to win at this level. No one expected him to be playing this much, of course. So this is less his fault than that of the undisciplined players at Ohio State, who were creatures of the entitlement culture and drew the suspensions for it that sank the season.
Many didn't see the benefit and likened passage to the state lottery's promise to fund education in Illinois. (Remember that?) A few wondered how even the biggest infusion of cash could overcome the budget holes faced by Chicago and Illinois. One man seemed on the verge of moving away.

For evidence, look no further than the brand new contracts the Brown Administration has just negotiated with many of its workers. The budget package Brown is piecing together relies in part on a savings of 10 percent from these contracts. But an independent analysis of the deals suggests they will save far less than that next year and will probably increase state costs in the long run.
After a root beer float ($3.50) at the vintage lunch counter, take time to explore the well-curated exhibits that fill the depot's sepia-tinged rooms. Then wander along the colonnade that fronts the railway, where signs forlornly announce long-forgotten passenger services even as ponderously laden freight trains roll past. The freight trains are noisy reminders of the fact that Kelso was built only to make other journeys possible. Now, in retirement, this palm-shaded intersection of history, geography and railway is at last a destination itself.

Montage about the pressure of the season halfway through. People hurt. It's hard. They're tired. Nothing new to report. Oooh, we find out next week is "Classical Night." And now it's time for a Macy's Stars of Dance performance choreographed by Travis Wall. It's a classical version of a pop song that I can almost figure out. Oh, wow, one of the dances is doing wire work, to enhance the feel of wind and breeze that's been in the dance so far. I think this is a "classical" version of Usher's "Without You." There were several familiar SYTYCD faces in that number. I love when the shows cross-pollinate like that.

Unlike the other jobs here, only a small percentage of heavy equipment operators are self-employed, according to the BLS. Jobs can be found in highway, bridge and railroad construction, as well as civil engineering and local government projects. Before you start searching for high-paying contractor jobs, remember that as a contractor, you'll be paying self-employment taxes. On the other hand, you'll be able to write off business-related expenses, so be sure to save every receipt.
For Ajjawi, who says she gets uncomfortable around Israelis when she travels abroad, the solution is simple: All the refugees should come back, and "All the Jews who have come to Palestine since 1948 should go back. They have their own countries."
It's unusual to pay editorial tribute to anyone twice in such a brief span, but Jobs' influence on the daily lives of Americans -- and people the industrialized world over -- demands another word of recognition.
“A Separation”
He added that "no evidence" of more widespread phone hacking was found. He said that phone hacking was "not condoned either by me personally or anybody else on the staff of the News of the World."

We’ve already mentioned Gutzon Borglum’s commitment to Newark, through his seated Lincoln, but he also made the gigantic bronze artillery crew called “The Wars of America” in Military Park. Those two bronzes were, in fact, two of the three sculptures commissioned by furniture maker Amos Van Horn as a gift to the city (the third was the statue of George Washington done by Rhind in Washington Park; the Van Horn gift inspired the Colleoni bequest).
"Enough about me," Garza said. "These guys played hard for nine. We didn't quit, and down to the last out we kept fighting and fighting. I think it's just a little more growth there for our young club and that's a huge step forward for us."

Another theory is that the Reds worked Chapman as a starter in spring training, and that gave him a chance to develop his slider and split-fingered fastball. Chapman pitched well enough in the spring to earn a spot in the rotation, but when relievers Ryan Madson and Nick Masset went down, Chapman was moved back to the bullpen.
"I can't give you a timetable," Broyles said. "I'm doing all the weight-room stuff, all the running stuff, I'm getting my flexibility as well. So I'm on pace to just look good. I feel better than ever right now, to be honest."

The club surely had Vega to thank for the big turnout, but the renovations suggest it's not just coasting on its laurels. In addition to technical upgrades to the sound system and DJ booths, there are several new lounges — one by the bar, and another for ambient house between the two smaller dance floors. There's also new Chinese lanterns and poppy gallery lights and new seating, including, in the main dancefloor, a raised platform full of long couches in one end and a brightly-lit lounge ensconced in another corner.
In sum, a perfect storm of abdication and favoritism, leaving the very devastation from which so-called conservative politicians promise to steer us. Gimme shelter, because they're winning.
These include real estate, car dealerships, betting parlors, art galleries, notaries, and, possibly, religious institutions. Mirroring "know your customer" regulations in the banking world, the rules would require disclosure of cash purchases for more than 200,000 pesos, or about $14,000, of numerous goods and place a cap of 1 million pesos, or about $70,000, on cash purchases of real estate.

As someone who very much misses Ginza Sushiko, the legendary sushi bar in Beverly Hills, I was thrilled that Masa Takayama was opening Bar Masa at CityCenter. In a soaring space the size of an airplane hangar, Takayama presents sublime sushi, and in the adjacent Shaboo, set-price shabu-shabu meals at $500 per person. For me, Masa is one of the country's greatest chefs. But Bar Masa is by no means Ginza Sushiko, and it isn't supposed to be. The a la carte menu is pretty standard sushi fare, albeit with seafood flown in daily from Tokyo's Tsukiji market.
Patients, insurers and others with skin in the game have a right to wonder whether an arrangement that promotes the health of a doctor's bank account might not have undue influence over the medical decisions they make for their patients.
In the years following the 9/11 tragedy, one woman emerged as a voice for survivors: Tania Head. Her story of escaping from the 78th floor of the South Tower, and losing her fianc in the North Tower, became legendary . . . until it fell apart. Under closer scrutiny, the inconsistencies of Tania’s story were impossible to ignored or attribute to post-traumatic stress. The truth is she was not in the South Tower on that awful day at all. This revelation was a terrible blow to the community of 9/11 survivors.

But Curtis has dreams. Nightmares, more to the point, of motor-oil-esque rain falling from the sky, of an apocalyptic storm, of shadowy, menacing figures outside the windows, of the beloved family dog turning on him.

With fewer athletes than many of the opposing schools, neither Lynbrook nor Saratoga fared well during the De Anza dual meet season. Lynbrook's boys and girls both finished 2-4 and in fifth place, while the Falcons were winless in both categories. The younger teams showed promise, though, as the Vikings' frosh-soph boys placed fourth with a 3-3 record and Saratoga's JV girls took fourth with a 2-4 mark.

He read Roger Angell and Muriel Spark, Stephen Dobyns and A.E. Coppard, "Ulysses" (thrice) and "Slaughterhouse-Five" (six times). He read with a hunger that made me envious, and framed each experience with succinct humor.
The combination of the LPO’s principal conductor Vladimir Jurowski, who at 39 has become a widely acclaimed and much-watched artist, with the already iconic pianist Emanuel Ax, made for a high-powered, invigorating performance of Beethoven’s Piano Concerto No. 5 “Emperor.” Here, and to a greater extent in Brahms’ Symphony No. 4, Jurowski emphasized the mighty character of the pieces. If the sound sometimes seemed forced and the playing was not always up to par (most noticeably from the horns), the performance certainly made an impact.

The hypocrisy: One of the bigger scams in Florida politics is the way some Republican politicians claim to oppose gambling — even as they suck up gambling money like piglets on a swollen momma sow for their own campaigns. A few years ago, the Sentinel actually counted each and every donation to the Republican Party of Florida and found that nearly one out of every five dollars came from casinos and gambling interests. And the current bills are being championed by Republicans like Jones in the Senate and Erik Fresen of Miami in the House.
In the early 1960s, Strick commissioned legendary Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer to design a house for him and his first wife, Anne, on the edge of Santa Monica Canyon.

Iolani Palace: The only royal palace in the U.S., it is a reminder that Hawaii was a sovereign nation taken over by the United States in a dubious series of events in the 1890s. Built in central Honolulu by King Kalakaua, it shows Hawaiian rulers had embraced the architecture, culture and religion of the West as symbols of modernization.

When I moved to Cleveland and later University Heights it was more difficult to visit the night sky because of the bright city lights. But, a drive to the lakefront or further away from the city helped. Now I live further east and can on a clear, velvet black night see a number of my old friends, including the Milky Way.
Now, many of these moves can be second-guessed as policy. I opposed both the bailouts of Wall Street and Detroit and think there is a good case to be made that releasing the additional TARP funds now could lead to waste and a lack of political accountability. But Bush's moves have provided a smooth transition and will make it easier for Obama to hit the ground running when he takes office Tuesday. As president, Obama will have the obligation to make his own policy judgments.
We see a guy who survived six years with the Atlanta Hawks despite having to deal with two of the worst things a coach can face: Perhaps the most inept ownership consortium in the NBA, and a knucklehead who was always too obstinate to win with and too good to trade.

If these ideas don't suit them, the "occupy" folks could always sue the airlines for allowing cockroaches on board flights, thereby causing mental anguish.

CLEVELAND, Ohio -- One of the most profitable decisions in sports marketing occurred in the 1960s as leagues began licensing the sales of authentic and replica team jerseys.

Teammate Jeremiah Obeng Agyapong described him as a “perfect fit,” after last year’s starter, Joaquin DeJesus, graduated. Clinton didn’t have a set quarterback entering the summer.

He simply told his players he had a surprise for them. And what a surprise it has been.

Design-conscious friends who live in Vegas suggested Silk Road in the Vdara Hotel at CityCenter for breakfast for its sweeping views of CityCenter's architecture. The LEED-certified design by Karim Rashid is kind of fun, futuristic swirls in the colors of the spice road. Chef Martin Heierling (who created Sensi in the Bellagio) is one of the best in Vegas. What he's doing at this below-the-radar spot, which now only serves breakfast and lunch, I don't know. But do try his Turkish eggs, poached and layered with free-range turkey hash and topped with fiery kirmizi (a Turkish red pepper) butter.

In addition, mulch close to houses is also a problem, Kramer said. In dry conditions — like the ones New Jersey has experienced this spring — mulch can easily catch fire and spread to a structure. The fire will burn the outside of a building until it finds a way inside, meaning it could become quite large before a smoke detector even goes off.
Traa, the IMF envoy, urged the government to quickly make up for a slowdown in structural reforms in 2011, but also criticized contradicting statements being made from European leaders and talk of a mild restructuring of Greece's massive national debt.

Still, the state suffers under a stigma: the notion that wine can't be made in the desert. That Arizona wine is a gimmick that belongs in the gift shop with the scorpions embedded in Lucite. That it's a novelty, like pineapple wine in Hawaii or blackberry wine in Tennessee. The state's winemakers say even Arizona residents register skepticism that good wine can be had so close to home.

— Worst-case outcome: Greece's new leaders are unable to find common ground with international lenders. The IMF pulls the plug on future bailouts and richer European nations refuse to step in. Greece defaults and leaves the euro currency or is expelled.

Our slavish, mindless self-subordination to "international legitimacy" does nothing but allow Russia -- a pretend post-Soviet superpower -- to extend a protective umbrella over whichever murderous client it chooses. Obama has all but announced that Russia (or China) has merely to veto international actions -- sanctions, military assistance, direct intervention -- and the U.S. will back off.
“I am trying to serve a little bit more like Wimbledon because the ball here is very soft,” Nadal said. “It is not getting a lot of topspin, I try to play a little bit more flat. And for that reason, I am serving faster, that’s it.”
1. Young is starting at first baseman and batting cleanup this evening in Game 1, a sign of the Rangers' ability to adapt their lineup easily to the NL rules at minimal expense. The main mashers in the lineup are all still there. Their DH is capable of playing a position, and well. And, the only quirk that they had to confront is where to Nelson Cruz, who at No. 7 in the lineup would studiously be pitched around because the pitcher was lurking two spots later. In response, manager Ron Washington has moved Cruz to No. 6, and he's backed by Mike Napoli, whose .380-some average was the second highest in the majors after the break.

What Matta, who reluctantly delved into foul talk after a long pause Friday, was getting at is physical teams who may try to neutralize skilled players with aggressive play. How a game is called matters so much to Ohio State because the Buckeyes count on two separate foul realities on opposite ends of the court.
Ripken: Working with kids. It's kind of funny. I joked as a baseball player, when you have a career in baseball, you never have to grow up. If you look at the players around, you have many examples of that. I always felt like a kid. My job was actually playing a game. You're almost insulated from growing up to real responsibility. I think what keeps you young is to keep that mind-set that you're still a kid, you're still aspiring, you're still learning, you're still energetic and curious about everything you do.

To that, Dunham adds her own blend of understated sadness and warmth. Hannah and her sisters-under-the-skin are maddeningly self-absorbed yet touchingly exposed. In their early 20s, the characters are at the stage of life when you take chances, experiment and make epic blunders as part of the learning process. But Dunham captures the harshness of the historical moment we're living in, when competition for jobs is fierce; mistakes can be fatal; and male-female relationships can be an unsteady mess, neither traditional nor evolved.

Blast Roy for being honest if it makes you feel better. Wish him gone. But know he's devastated over his inability to feel comfortable dropping in and out of the game. It's why he let it rip to two reporters who cared to ask what it feels like to be forgotten. The three-time All-Star said he felt disrespected and under-utilized, and Roy cried out for anyone willing to believe in him anymore. More than what he said, was the tone in which he said it.

Q: Hey, Tony: The officiating crews have been more dominant than anybody's offense or defense and they're not getting more TV time just because teams are working the kinks out. I understand their positioning has changed this year, enabling one of the officials to see and be able to call more penalties. That combined with mandatory reviews on touchdowns and additional flags flying on petty or bad calls may lead to household-name officials dragging games out to 31/2 hours or more. Bad calls not subject to review like the calls on D'Qwell Jackson and Brian Robiskie will continue to aggravate the fans while the penalty against Andy Reid for requesting a review on a play that is now automatically going to be reviewed (figure that one out) was simply bizarre. -- Jan Bilson, Bradenton, Fla.

Even if he gets more votes than Romney in Tuesday's primary, Santorum faces a disadvantage in terms of Ohio's delegates because he filed incomplete delegate slates in six of Ohio's 16 congressional districts.

Stepping into one of the studios was a small shock. They are 100 square feet, about 30 square feet less than a standard inside cabin on this ship. But they are marvels of engineering, with more storage space than I could fill. The bed, two twins made up as one, was pushed against one wall, leaving a narrow path to access a tiny desk with a flat-screen TV above it and two small closets.

We're not gonna have a strong economy, folks, or a limited government, if the family continues to decline. Thirty years ago, 71% of people over the age of 18 were married in America.

And as that occurs, government will get bigger, and the ability for us to lower taxes and create a vibrant economy will get harder.

The whole purpose of the editorial page of a newspaper, in R.C.'s view, was to get people to think ... the exposure of readers to libertarian ideas in the editorial page was designed to awaken in them the concept of self-rule and self-control. In fact, R.C. saw "the editorial page of a newspaper, which is kept open for contrary points of view, and which is well prepared and thoughtfully assembled, as a daily school room made available to its subscribers," whether "rich or poor, young or old, and without the duress of taxes nor the compulsion of forced attendance."

Another friend, a bit of a skeptic by nature, wondered why God would need such good abs. "Would he be any less awesome with a big, flabby gut?" That's a good question, too. In fact, human nature being what it is, a civilization of flabby people should envision a flabby God - one who is like unto ourselves. We like crafting God in our own image. So I suppose I can understand why a ripped, Gold's Gym kind of guy would be all stoked about God with a six pack. But that doesn't make it so. Unless, maybe, he was talking metaphorical abs. There are plenty of places in scripture that use physical imagery when speaking of God.

However, as one senior official said this week, the ECB could contribute not by taking a loss—but by "forgoing profits."

In "To End All Wars: A Story of Loyalty and Rebellion, 1914-1918," Adam Hochschild challenges this image of the European home front. In this beautifully written and compellingly narrated story of Britain at war, Hochschild forces us to think about the Great War from the dual perspectives of those who prosecuted it and those who decried it. His primary focus is on well-known "divided families," such as that of John French, hero of the Boer War, first commander in chief of the British Expeditionary Forces and last viceroy of Ireland, and his sister Charlotte Despard, militant suffragette, Labour Party activist, antiwar activist and, later, Sinn Fein member. As French ordered British soldiers through enemy fire and poison gas at the battles of Ypres and Loos, Despard sat in Holloway Prison on reduced rations and under the British prison code of silence.

Five days after the breakfast taping, TMZ.com breaks the news that Vicki Gunvalson has filed for divorce.
Dear Margo: I met my girlfriend six years ago online when I was in college. I lived in the U.S. at the time, and she lived in Europe. After speaking regularly for two years, leading up to eight-page letters every other day, we decided to meet in person. When we did, we began an official romantic relationship. We visited each other twice a year for three to four weeks in our respective countries. The problem came from my roommate's reaction when I informed him she would be visiting (her first time) and staying in our apartment. We three roommates at the time were all Christians, but apparently with different views on what is acceptable behavior. One roommate, "Bob," objected to my girlfriend's visit on the grounds of moral impropriety. He was so adamant that he told me that if she stayed, even if I slept on the couch, he would have to leave our apartment during that time. Part of me felt that the apartment was his, too, and therefore he should have a say, but another part felt that as a grown man in a committed relationship, I should not be forced to divide my already minimal time with her by having her stay elsewhere. Ultimately, I allowed Bob to live elsewhere during her stay. To this day, I wonder whether I made the wrong choice in choosing my desires (and my girlfriend's) over Bob's. We are still friends, but the friendship does seem to have been silently fractured by the incident. — Lingering Thoughts

Latin rhythms have been part of jazz in some fashion or another since practically the beginning. That's what Jelly Roll Morton was getting at when he spoke of the "Spanish tinge" as an essential part of the music as early as the mid-1920s.

Due to ongoing concerns about below normal precipitation, Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Bob Martin encouraged residents across New Jersey to take steps to conserve water, both inside the home and outside. While recent rainfall has helped ease this year’s precipitation deficits somewhat, the effects of an unusually dry winter and spring are starting to be felt across the state. “Overall our major water supplies, including reservoirs and deep aquifers, remain in good shape,” Commissioner Martin said. “But after too much precipitation last year, we’ve now swung in the opposite direction, with months of below normal precipitation. Most concerning is that our stream levels and shallow groundwater supplies are severely stressed. Our goal is to begin moderating demand by asking residents to voluntarily conserve water before peak summer use begins.”

My perspective is actually quite conservative. Why in the world would we use taxpayer dollars to harm private property values and burden cities? Cities can't afford the damage, and the nation can't afford pouring more money into ineffective infrastructure. Not only does this kind of spending privilege traffic over people, freeways in cities don't work.

Best lesser-known baseball shrine: Hoboken, N.J. The antithesis of Cooperstown. It was here, across the Hudson River from Manhattan, that historians believe the first organized game of baseball was played June 19, 1846. The game at Elysian Fields was umpired by Alexander Joy Cartwright, using his rules that are still the basis of the game. The New York Base Ball Club, also called The New York Nine, crushed the Knickerbockers, 23-1. Since the Cooperstown legend held sway until the latter half of the 20th century, Hoboken never reaped much benefit from its key role in the history of the game. Elysian Fields is long gone, with only a marker at 11th and Washington streets memorializing the site.

If the words "Measure Q" on T-shirts aren't meant to encourage people to vote yes, then surely all those lawn signs that say "Obama-Biden '08" are just there to let you know who's on the ballot. What nonsense. Voters may go for many of the local measures on the Nov. 4 ballot, but shady tactics with public money will just make it harder to win their trust the next time cities, school boards and other agencies come asking for more.

Rauh argues that pension liabilities should be valued using a risk-free interest rate, like the yield on U.S. Treasury bonds. The 10-year Treasury yielded 3.6 percent in mid-2009, and that has fallen to 1.99 percent today. State and local governments typically use a much higher discount rate, like 8 percent, making their official liability figures much smaller than Rauh's estimates.

Overall, there should be 400 to 450 carries for the taking, maybe even more with Pryor's quarterback runs no longer part of the script. One back hit 200 carries in six of the last seven seasons, but that's unlikely this year. In part, that's because when Herron returns for the Nebraska game, he'll fill some role, maybe even as the No. 1 back.

Nobody has tested the boundaries of this new super campaign finance world, which has overwhelmed the laws passed in the 1970s in the wake of the Watergate scandal. Back then, individuals and groups could give campaigns a maximum of $5,000 per election cycle in most cases. The purpose was to eliminate big gifts that could be seen as bribes, while allowing candidates to raise sufficient funds for a national campaign. Surprise, surprise--lawyers found ways around the limits, largely by funneling money through groups that were not a formal part of any campaign and were focused on "issues" rather than directly electing candidates. This freed up unions, businesses, and public interest groups to engage in political campaigns, as long as they remained independent of all parties and candidates.

That is what happens with the 7104 CRT "superluminal velocity". I doubt this has anything to do with Chrenkov radiation either, no matter what the paper argues.

The particle is still traveling slower than c (the scientific notation for the speed of light) but the speed of light in the medium (such as water) is less than c, so no laws of physics are broken.

I do not doubt that for political reasons this price will be paid and that the euro-zone inhabitants will never find out just how much the euro truly cost them.

3. Daniel Hudson is on the disabled list now, sidelined with a worrisome shoulder injury (not too surprising given his 227 innings pitched last year) but if he’s all right he’ll pitch well for Arizona, which should contend in the NL West. I hated the deal that sent Hudson to the Diamondbacks for Edwin Jackson from the instant it was announced. I had a feeling for Hudson as a guy, not just a pitcher, and knew he was mature beyond his years. He was practically a married man after his three years at Old Dominion, and in the summer of 2009 traveled through the White Sox farm system, never in one place for even two months, with his college girlfriend. The two of them handled everything thrown their way.
How can your doc tell which group you're in? Not by lookin' at you.

So I went and I drank tequila, because that’s what I saw everyone else doing.

For the current tax season, refund anticipation loans -- often called "Rapid Refunds" -- will be even more expensive and harder to get than in the past. That's because the IRS has stopped using a code that told tax preparers whether individuals would receive their entire refund, or if some would be held back to cover back taxes, missed child support, student loan payments or other liens. Tax prep companies used the code, known as a debt indicator, as a sort of credit check for a population seen as high risk.

"I'm no expert on the Browns, but after seeing them let Peyton Hillis go and sign, for such a little amount of money, to Kansas City it's obvious they need help at running back," the scout said.

He is the type of back who will help the passing game via running the football, by blocking incoming pass rushers/blitzes and Trent can be a passing outlet for McCoy when things really break down inside the pocket."

Both proved themselves not only suited to the task of taking on Abbasi's head-swimmingly knotted compositions, but added new wrinkles in songs that easily stretched past the 20 minute mark.

5. The Rams would have to give up a draft choice for Tebow. No one is sure what Denver is asking for, and the Broncos won't get what they want.

But all that frustration, he says, came with a silver lining: It provided fodder for a stage drama. "I felt stifled almost a priori on 'Brothers and Sisters,'" he said.

And she said MTC added razor wire - not then required by Texas at minimum-security facilities - after the Texas escapes. She said that after the Department of Labor determination, MTC voluntarily audited all its facilities and compensated any employees who were due back wages.

The tentative debt limit agreement President Barack Obama and leaders in Congress negotiated over the weekend is awful. It involves extensive spending cuts at a time when economic growth and job creation are practically non-existent, all without actually providing enough deficit reduction to secure our long-term prosperity. It offers no assurance (and considerable doubt) that the wealthy and large corporations, who now pay as low a percentage of their incomes in taxes as at any time in decades, will contribute anything whatsoever to the ultimate solution, and it represents less an example of a well-functioning democracy than a case of panicky deal-making. Also, it might not actually pass Congress before the nation starts running out of money to pay its bills tomorrow.

Hey, Tony: Playing on lousy teams can often cost players recognition in things like the Pro Bowl, All-Pro teams, and other awards. What about the HOF?

It would seem to me he'd be a good candidate for enshrinement, but would playing on a bad team cost him the ultimate individual award, or make him wait longer than he should? -- Josh Winkler, Hilliard

The play-in game will make it very difficult for a wild card team to ride one dominant starting pitcher to playoff glory. Josh Beckett won the NLDS opener for the 2003 Marlins, pitched in three of their victories over the Cubs in the NLCS (twice as a starter, once in relief) and closed out the Yankees with a complete game in the World Series clincher.
The garden's colorful curves symbolize ocean waves, but also waves of energy and even the "waves of grain" familiar to this Midwestern environment.
"There are still many areas up here that lack high-speed Internet service," she said. "Given how critical that service is to businesses, I can see a lot of people being able to now work out of their homes or even move up to the mountain and still be able to continue business operations."
Richardson noted that Kitzhaber essentially rejected the old way of budgeting, which was to estimate how much the same level of government services would cost, then try to match that with state spending. Under those measures, the state would need to spend more than $18 billion in 2011-13, which would mean a shortfall of about $3.5 billion.
He sounded a cautionary note, explaining that a new stage could be fantastic, but noted that it would demand reworking the already completed 2012 performance grid involving more than 80 acts: As artistic director, I have to concern myself with the artists and the audience experience.

Beer Guy: A scoop of spreadable English pub-style cheddar was the saving grace of this otherwise run-of-the-mill burger. The cheese's sharp, salty tang pleasantly enhanced the bland meat and a crumbly sesame-seed bun. Thick-cut tomatoes and onions were highlights of the anemic fixings bar. The fries: Our piping-hot fries were made to order, but their interiors had the telltale mealiness of being frozen.
What Richardson saw reminded him instantly of the chaos he witnessed during the Watts riots in 1965 and the Washington, D.C., riots in 1968. Determined to see the situation for himself, he drove his Mercedes south along Crenshaw Boulevard to Florence Avenue before swinging west to Inglewood. As scattered fires burned, Richardson said he didn't feel threatened. He was black, after all, and it was blacks who were rioting after the acquittal of four white police officers in the beating of Rodney King, a black man.
In a 911 call released Wednesday, one of the people who discovered the bodies said, "I can't tell if there's two mannequins or two people burning."

I've never seen him anywhere close to that emotional and I was genuinely touched by his words. At this point, all that I can say - cliche-ish though it may be - is that I'm weighing my options, which are considerable, before I want to say anything further.
But throughout the forum, Patmon hammered at the mayor's leadership. He questioned Jackson's record on economic development, education and public safety. He also used Jackson's own words against him, ridiculing his opponent for his oft-quoted "it is what it is" mantra. That peharps inspired Jackson to strike a defiant tone in his closing remarks.
Improved decision-making. That was one of those goals to come from last January’s meeting, all of which are written at the three points of a triangle used by the Gracie family, the famed Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu clan admired by Sullivan, a former Army Ranger, Jiu-Jitsu blue belt and mixed-martial-arts fanatic.

Speaking of fighting, Woods almost did that Tuesday afternoon at Reser, when he and linebacker Michael Doctor engaged in a minor shoving match during the scrimmage period. They were separated before anything serious could happen — the last thing this team needs is more injuries because of a fight between teammates — but Woods said that type of passion is necessary sometimes.

The Lakers' biggest weakness involves their transition defense; they don't have the speed to always get back on defense. But they made that worse by forcing bad entry passes and lacking ball movement. As much as the Lakers struggled in their rotations, the way they ran their offense largely contributed to the defensive drop-off.

Although the players were able to experience a few moments of laughter, all they had to do was look into the stands of Jeld-Wen Field during training sessions this week to see the more serious side to the team's problems. Owner Merritt Paulson and general manager Gavin Wilkinson spent time meticulously watching -- and probably evaluating -- the players. Their presence served as a follow-up to Paulson's Twitter comment after the team's loss at Montreal that said, "I don't believe we have a talent issue. We do have issues and those issues need to be addressed."

Ireland has seen that multiculturalism -- immigrants from Africa, Eastern Europe, India, Pakistan, Latin America and China -- is vital to attracting international investment. Whereas Germany and Britain have bemoaned their failures, the Irish are embracing multiculturalism.

Although they're not in the same price range as the Sony and Marantz models you are comparing, you can find receivers and standalone amplifiers that use cool-running digital amplification.

Next let's address aesthetics. Not to sound cliché, but the sky is the limit when it comes to constructing your raised garden bed. Options can be as simple as a kit that comes with everything you need to build your own. Once you have an idea of how you want to build your raised bed, it is time to pick out your materials. You can work with materials from composite, wood, metal, plastic or stone. Any wood you use should be naturally rot-resistant (cedar, redwood and others) or have been pressure-treated to prevent decay.

A: I had seen this viral video called "The Last Lecture" of a professor in his final days delivering his final thoughts, a guy with terminal cancer, and I wanted to laugh. And I knew this was inappropriate. But you know, dying people's wisdom used to be a very private thing. Now, with the Internet, it's much more public. And that's what I wanted to explore, this strange collision of public and private that the Internet seems to be making not just possible but omnipresent.

“You mentioned nothing about the money a person "would not receive" by waiting to begin their benefits at age 66 versus age 62 or at age 70 versus 66. I've been doing the math for the past 5 1/2 years and it goes like this; assume (and I hate using that word), for a moment, that one's benefit at age 62 was $1500 and at age 66 would be $1950 (by the way, the math is the same for waiting to begin benefits at age 70 instead of at 66). In this example, by waiting four years to begin receiving benefits, the money "not received" would $72,000 (48 X $1500). Dividing the $72,000 by $450 (the difference between benefits by waiting till age 66) equals / results in the number 160. That's the number of months a person (who waited till age 66 to begin benefits) will have to live beyond age 66 JUST TO BREAK EVEN by not beginning benefits at age 62. That's 13 1/3 years. What a gamble!!”

Corzine and the state attorney general at the time, Anne Milgram, argued that releasing the e-mails would violate the governor’s right to communicate confidentially in the course of his decision-making process.

The scoop: Advertising executive Jeff Moreau did his homework before opening in March at this storefront near Cleveland Public Theatre. It's a soothing, glamorous spot for handmade ice cream, popcorn and candy. Within French vanilla walls, he placed a stainless-steel fountain from the 1940s and a mirrored back wall with Victorian wood frame and stained glass. It lights up, and so will you. The lick: House-made ice cream, made with cream from the local Smith Dairy. They're all good, but vanilla is superb, especially under lustrous caramel sauce or hot fudge, with its slightly higher cacao content. Don't miss the homemade root beer and other hand-fizzed "phosphates."

She is dead when Strayed finally arrives with her brother.
Of course, you find even more opportunities to pay less than you otherwise might. Any time you're in a captive or semi-captive situation, you can expect to be gouged. Hotel minibars are the prototypical captive gouge; your obvious defense is either to buy somewhere else or forego the item entirely. Hotel laundries are often so expensive that you'd pay less to go out and buy new items -- I've occasionally done that when a hotel's price list showed $7 for a pair of ordinary socks. You can also expect to be gouged at any port-area shop "recommended" by a cruise line's "port lecturer" or any store where your tour bus stops for a "break."

"The biggest impact that I'd say happened to me in my entire life is my daughter," Tierney said. "My daughter affected me on levels that is very difficult for me to articulate. You want to talk about a driving motivation -- as cheesy as it may sound and as cliche as it may sound -- but looking at that little girl gives me a perspective like nothing I've had in my life. She's my motivation. Every day, I am the best I can be."
"They play similar games.They're different body types, obviously. Greene is a smaller guy that uses his feet and Fayner is a big body guy. I think they complement each other that way," DeBoer said.

Jacobs' criteria for the system required that each penetration have a label that could be read by a barcode scanner with a PDA that could display who the installer was, when it was installed, what system was used, and any other pertinent information for that particular installation. She also wanted the system to track that location back to a building plan that could pinpoint exactly where the penetration was. In addition, she wanted photo documentation of the installation that then linked back to the previous records without having to manually enter all the data and link pictures with database files, etc. "I wanted a completely electronic system so that all of the information talked together without a full-time person manually connecting the dots and putting all of the data together to document one penetration or one barrier," she said.

In oral arguments Friday in Portland, Acosta found a great deal lacking in Cutler's decision.

"Me? Whhheeeee!"
U.S. Rep. Louie Gohmert of Texas may have been joking, but according to a February Washington Post story, he seemed serious at a Natural Resources Committee hearing concerning why the United States should support oil drilling in Alaska. Caribou, he said, are fond of the warmth of the Alaskan pipeline. "So when they want to go on a date, they invite each other to head over to the pipeline," he said. That mating ritual, Gohmert concluded, is surely responsible for a recent tenfold increase in the local caribou population.

In the Chicago series last year (when the Hawks lost in six games in the conference semifinals to the Bulls) is where he emerged as a true starter in this league. He’s good in the spotlight. He’s all over the place. If we keep him out of the paint it really helps us, because he’s able to get into the paint and then draw and kick. He’s very key.”

Lincoln Cannon, who represents the Oregon Forest Industries Council, urged the committee to leave tax incentives for biomass energy intact. It's an emerging industry that still needs help to get going, he said.

Newt Gingrich, who as recently as last month held a 20-point lead here, initially seemed to understand that job. His closing Iowa argument was that voters faced a choice between a "Massachusetts moderate" and a candidate born to a "bold Reagan conservatism" that highlighted economic growth and opportunity. Whether that message would have rescued Mr. Gingrich from his sliding poll numbers, we'll never know.

There's been a lot of conversation about bullying lately and a big push to stop bullying of children in schools and on-line. I find all this outrage at bullying hypocritical on the part of the adults, school system, pundits, etc. Children learn by the examples set by the adults in their lives.

A survey of Port Authority meeting minutes shows that before that vote, commissioners had unanimous votes on 302 resolutions during 42 meetings since January 2008, which means they cast 2,068 votes in favor — and none against.

A: Our focus right now is to get events going in other cities. With regards to the potential for future parades here, we're looking into that. And other events. For instance, on March 6, Brian Owens, the national recording artist formerly with Sidewinder, is having a concert at the Old Rock House in St. Louis and part of the proceeds will go to support the foundation. That's just an example. We plan on having other events to help the cause in the future. Right now, our focus is helping other cities to keep bumping up the level of awareness. That's important, because a small percentage of our population has been fighting our wars for us. We have a great responsibility as a society to show our appreciation for them and to take care of these people. But everybody has stepped up to the plate, and it's been really gratifying to see that happen.

Four Oregon players got in on the party, as Isaac Remington, Josh Kaddu, Taylor Hart and Dion Jordon combined for three sacks. Overall, the Ducks forced a season-high five turnovers and Remington’s sack in the third quarter with 8:41 forced Luck to fumble, setting up Oregon’s fifth score of the night. After LaMichael James’ 4-yard touchdown run, the Ducks had a 36-16 lead and Stanford was all but done.

The tactics are another factor. Peter Vermes' highly disruptive pressing system has all 10 out-field players harassing and haranguing the opponents over every blade of grass in the stadium. On Wednesday, KC's second goal might have technically been an own goal from a Matt Besler throw-in, but it was literally created by Sapong applying pressure on a Vancouver defender deep into the Whitecaps corner.* That pressure creates turnovers. Turnovers create scoring chances. Turnovers also speed up the game. There aren't a lot of teams who have shown that they can hang with KC in a fast and physical game.

"That was a tremendous football game for those that really enjoy football at its very basic element," said Coughlin, who matched former Cowboys coach Tom Landry for most road playoff wins, seven.

Columbia River: The team hopes to regroup after starting fast but losing nine of its last 10 games to finish 8-12 a year ago. Columbia River returns three starters in forward Isaiah Smith and guards Brandon Scheidel and Gunnar Wahl. Smith, a 6-7 sophomore, averaged 11.3 points last season. Coach David Long said Columbia River "might be the deepest team I've ever coached." Some of that depth comes from a junior varsity team that was 18-2 a year ago.
Vazquez wanted to live somewhere close enough for his wife and daughter to visit often. But he didn't want to live in a border town because he thought it would be too dangerous. Magdalena, about an hour's drive south of the border, seemed the best choice.
Aldridge, who said he came out "tentative" at the start, committed an early turnover, picked up two quick fouls and missed his first two shots. He didn't make his first field goal until he converted a layup off a nice pass from Gerald Wallace with 2:27 left in the first quarter. The Blazers struggled to get him the ball through the flow of the offense and he labored to get open throughout the first.
"The order is crippling because it forbids the state from entering a consent agreement at the very time that a decision is necessary," the state appeal said. "If the court fails to stay the trial court's order ... this opportunity may be forever lost."

The verdict: Allen’s less interested in Gil’s romance (or lack thereof) with Inez than his love affair with the city, which is a pure delight even as “Midnight in Paris” threatens to become a series of cultural name-checking (here’s Matisse, there’s Bunuel, etc.). Very funny and deeply charming, “Midnight in Paris” is a living dream about feeling at home somewhere else, with someone else. The movie salutes that sense of escape while recognizing that nostalgia comes with a certain amount of denial about the present, though Allen’s too emotionally insulated to let his characters truly suffer for their loneliness. Wilson’s excellent as a guy with diverging impulses as both a writer (Hollywood schlock vs. artistic novel) and a man (unpleasant fiancé vs. new fantasy woman). He’s supported by similarly lively work by Cotillard, Michael Sheen (as smugness personified) and Adrien Brody as Salvador Dali. The way he pronounces “rhinoceros” is a thing of beauty.

JLWOP is inconsistent with the principles of fairness and proportionality. The Eighth Amendment to the Constitution requires that criminal sentences be proportionate to the underlying offenses and reflect "evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society." Ironically, in 1899, Illinois was the first state to create a juvenile justice system, recognizing that kids should be treated differently by courts. This principle has been lost.

Alas. Since Mack is nothing if not an enthusiast, he is now telling everybody he knows that they've got to go see "Brokeback Mountain" right now. But since everybody he knows, except me, is like him, they just laugh like hyenas and tell him he's nuts.
And the pace of decline in the S&P/Case-Shiller index slowed. That suggests, some economists said, that prices are stabilizing. The index fell 3.5 percent over the 12 months that ended in February. That's the smallest annual drop in a year.
"Last year we played Perry at point guard, and he did a pretty good job trying to learn that position, but he's more of a two guard," Granite City coach Steve Roustio said. "With Omar Walker rejoining us this year, Perry was able to play the position that's really kind of meant for him. He's a very good shooter -- we like for him to look for his offense, and we like Omar to try to find him."

Medical and bioethical experts say otherwise — that an abundance of scientific evidence shows that dying people naturally stop eating and drinking for a reason — their bodies are shutting down — and that force-feeding them at that point actually causes pain. In contrast, without food and drink, the metabolism produces substances that actually produce feelings of euphoria.

"I really don't understand what should be investigated," Boehner said. "The American people are concerned about this. No one doubts the right of these people to build a mosque where they see fit.

A. Out-of-control ficus, often called rubber trees, are always a problem. My professor would give the really tall ones to the local zoo, but yours is still a manageable size. Planting it outside has risks including cold damage and growth of a plant that could take over the garden or patio. Why not keep it in the container and give it some judicious pruning?
In Florissant, Ray, a widower in his 70s, was looking for a way to retire from his job at a construction firm. But his $600 monthly mortgage payment was more than he could afford on his savings and Social Security.
The 5-foot-11, 198-poun Datsyuk is not the biggest player in the NHL. Hes also not the fastest, nor does he have the hardest shot. But he thinks the game at a different level. Often, there isnt a type of situation he cant slither out of or create offense from.
The Magic brass will not let this become another Shaquille O'Neal situation. Howard has made it clear he wants out. Where doesn't matter. Send him to Los Angeles, Chicago, New Jersey or anywhere else Howard has hinted he wants to play.

Shin was seeking the payment agreement for two properties in the borough — 806 and 258 Glassboro Road. His client, Chang-Ho Chun, hasn’t had tenants to assist in paying more than $20,000 in property taxes currently due, but expects to have businesses in place in the future.
Did government mandate this subprime surge to aid less-than-wealthy borrowers? No. And it would seem bizarre to think that the government forced Bear Stearns and other Wall Street investment banks to pocket billions in historically high profits by bundling millions of these "innovative products" into pools laxly given the highest credit ratings for sale to investors worldwide -- yet many conservative commentators would have you believe this.
"He was maybe the best friend you could have. Really decent guy," Smith said. "He was very competitive, but he had a soft spot for the underdog, I think."

In adapting Herman Melville's novella, Britten and his librettists - E.M. Forster and Eric Crozier - invented a prologue and epilogue in which Captain Vere, now an old man, reflects on the events of the story. In brief, a good-natured young foretopman, Billy Budd, is falsely accused by the master-at-arms, John Claggart, of fomenting mutiny. Tongue-tied, Billy strikes Claggart dead, and Vere - despite his conviction that Billy is innocent - feels he has no choice but to see him hanged.

• I wrote yesterday about the Blazers' cool shooting since the All-Star break. So much for that. The Blazers shot 50.6 percent from the field against the Heat, ending a run of seven consecutive games in which they were below 50 percent.
Though college football coaches generally issue recommendations so glowing that they could light Las Vegas, it's often instructive to seek out their talking points about former players: what attributes they choose to emphasize; what areas they prefer to gloss over. If Reyes is reputedly short on closing speed and stamina, if he admits to losing leverage by sometimes playing too high, his versatility and adaptability make him an appealing and intriguing choice.
Records: Dallas (57-25), Portland (48-34)
This season, perennial All-Stars Dirk Nowitzki of Dallas, Pau Gasol of the Lakers and Tim Duncan of San Antonio are having down years statistically, and only Nowitzki was selected to the West squad.

Matheny was well-aware that Lynn was coming off consecutive 100-pitch starts and was prepared to handle him conservatively Monday.

Over the last decade, Nagele documented his own theory of the disease focusing on the so-called "blood-brain barrier" which separates proteins and antibodies in the blood of healthy patients from their brains. When a patient has Alzheimer’s, the natural barrier breaks down and the brain is flooded with blood plasma, including the autoantibodies. Inflammation and irreparable damage — and degenerative dementia — are the results, Nagele and his team hypothesize.

Harbaugh on Osemele competing at guard: "Yes, I think that would be a possibility. Left guard or right tackle. Just let those guys compete and see also who meshes better where with Jah being in the mix, also Michael Oher being in the mix, Bryant McKinnie being in the mix. It gives us some competition and we like that. "

For dessert, the lemon verbena panna cotta ($8.50) with a drizzle of olive oil and wild strawberries is a perfect ending, but then so is the much richer chocolate ganache tart ($8.50) and cooling bitter caramel gelato with roasted cherries and peaches ($5). The only thing that didn't meet expectations was the cookie plate ($6.50).

As with any fractured relationship, there's probably too much posturing here borne mostly out of misunderstanding. Angelos likely isn't as nefarious as fans make him out to be -- he just wants to make money, they shout -- and the fans aren't as ungrateful or uneducated or unworthy of contact as maybe Angelos and his top advisers might think.

In some parts of China, favored firms get official status as "protected businesses," immune from environmental inspection. In Anhui province in eastern China, six environmental inspectors were fired last spring because, as China Central Television reported, they were working too hard: They had the effrontery to check on a tire factory three times in one month. "Doing that to a business really affects our development environment," a local official explained.

You can bike in a dress - and most any outfit: For the fashion-conscious riders out there, you do not need to sacrifice style while biking. When wearing a skirt or dress, tip your bike to the side to get on. If your skirt is too long, you can tie the excess back with a rubber band. If it is too short, you can always wear bike shorts or leggings underneath.

Everyone needs to calm down. It's early May. And although the "out indefinitely" phraseology does conjure up depressing thoughts, it's not as bad as it could be. Sandoval had the same issue in his right hand last year and was only out of action six weeks. Even under the worst case scenario, he should be back by the All-Star break.
Manning plays quarterback at a different NFL level than Tebow. Denver's offense with Manning won't be the same as Denver's offense with Tebow. Manning has had the most impact on offense, in terms of his preparation, control and execution, of any quarterback in the modern era of the NFL. Now that he's with the Broncos, their offense will be a pocket-based attack. Manning will run the show, making play calls and decisions at the line of scrimmage.
NFL Network analyst Mike Mayock on Richardson: "When you draft an Alabama player, you know what you're getting. Coach Saban coaches them hard, he coaches them well, and they come into the NFL prepared and ready to play at a high level, day one.
The best meal of my visit was across the street from the market at St. John Bread & Wine (94-96 Commercial St.), which opened in 2003 as a more casual offshoot of the Michelin-star-winning St. John restaurant in nearby Smithfield. Both St. Johns revere "the whole beast" and load their menus with offal and cuts of meat seldom seen anywhere else. I ordered the deviled sprats -- just because it sounded good -- and soon confronted a plateful of six-inch fish, heads and skins attached, all so tender and savory that it was a joy to swallow their bodies, bones and all.
The report suggests that subsidized "economic development" programs are less about creating jobs than propping up local governments. Municipal governments depend on sales taxes to fund local services, which means they compete with one another to lure high-volume retailers to their jurisdictions - or prevent a neighboring community from stealing one way.
This year you'll see an abbreviated schedule with additional bridge lifts, the city said. The city usually conducts the bridge lifts on Saturdays and Wednesdays. But with the new schedule, some lifts will happen on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
In a large saute pan over medium heat, heat 1 1/2 tablespoons of the olive oil until hot but not smoking, and add the garlic. Saute for about 2 minutes, until the garlic is fragrant, then add half of the mushroom mixture, including the porcinis. Saute, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms are softened and slightly browned. Season to taste and set aside. Repeat with the remaining oil and mushrooms, then add to the reserved mushrooms and mix well. Add the parsley, toss to combine, and set aside.

The once-austere dining room is now warmer and sexier, with pale light, slate walls and candles glowing everywhere. But service needs work, as waiters seem bewildered by the new approach. Castagna's kitchen needs a translator: informed, confident servers who can bring us along on this unusual ride from the moment we sit down. And, good grief, why is Motown playing on the sound system? Does anyone really want to "hitchhike" to Marvin Gaye while eating food as riveting as a Charlie Parker riff?
And that’s something Einstein probably would have liked.

The American center-left got its fair share of euphoria in 2008  and then it learned that the election changed nothing. Now it's time to take hold of the political system by working within it.
Roshon seems dispirited, saying that he gives his all every week, but that he's not connecting. Aw, I've grown to like the kid, I want to see him succeed now. So now Roshon goes to Val to learn how to be more masculine - he's giving him some decent advice about body language and facial expressions. They're doing the Argentine tango to a "classical" version of Lady Gaga's "Bad Romance." I don't know if that's terrible or fantastic. Roshon's long, skinny legs look great as always - HELLO TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY - I just got about 10 seconds of the logo filling the screen instead of dancing. Roshon gets a pretty great foot flick sequence in near the end. Len says overall it was "clean" and "confident." Bruno says the lifts were "seamless" but he wants to see strength in the legs, because sometimes Roshon's legs get a little wobbly - Bruno, they are but tiny, skinny things, he's doing the best he can. Carrie Ann is so happy she comes around to hug him. He IS kinda adorable, right?
But it is a big deal. "My dad is a humble man, the most decent man in the world," said his son, Mike Villalta, who is the mayor of Los Banos. "People like him - workers and immigrants - built that bridge."

"Right now I'm still in the process of finishing my highlight tape," said Ware, who was a bit of a late bloomer, but ended up with just over 400 yards of total offense and numerous big plays on defense for the state quarterfinalist Wildcats. "I started offense and defense and if I compile all that together and try to make a good tape, maybe something will come of it."
Mr. Durham said Mr. Clemens brought back his old strength trainer—and alleged supplier of steroids—after being pulled off the mound in the third inning of the Yankees's 13-1 loss to the Boston Red Sox in a 1999 game at Fenway Park. Then, faced with the choice between admitting using banned substances or lying under oath, he chose perjury, Mr. Durham said.

Like many viewers across the country, "Idol" judges Jennifer Lopez, Steven Tyler and Randy Jackson have been understandably stunned that a singer so young and diminutive performs with so much skill, poise, dynamic control and musical maturity. In each of these regards, she seems to be superior to fellow contestants Hollie Cavanagh, Skylar Laine, Joshua Ledet and Phillip Phillips. (All of them will perform in San Diego when the 2012 "American Idol Live!" tour makes a July 26 stop here at Valley View Casino Center).

The liquid should then be brought to a simmer - slowly, according to most chefs, to maximize flavor extraction; quickly, according to Rodgers. Either way, a gray scum - coagulated protein - will rise to the surface as the water heats and must be rigorously skimmed to produce a clear stock. That's why vegetables and herbs are always added later; they would get in the way of thorough skimming.

I'm not about to run out to the sperm bank or to freeze my eggs. I'm still ambivalent, and single. Then again, I've always thought that one of the most exciting things about life is that there are things I might do in the future that I can't fathom now. Writing a book, meditation, even living in San Francisco, I never would have predicted I could do those things. If I do surprise myself by becoming a mother, I'll trace the first moments of considering the possibility to that dream. If I have a child, I'll tell her or him, you were first conceived in Bernal Heights.

Top Picks Analysis: General manager Mark Dominik was wheeling and dealing early and often, with the Buccaneers engineering three trades in the opening two rounds to land a trio of good players on the team's radar. Dominik's first order of business was to improve a secondary that was abysmal during last season's four-win disaster, and accomplished that mission by moving down two spots to the No. 7 pick and taking Barron, far and away this draft's best safety. The two-time BCS national champion is both a thumper against the run and an instinctual playmaker with the ball in the air, and his leadership and ability to diagnose the game are obvious pluses as well. Tampa Bay traded up to snare two other possible immediate starters in Martin, a compact and powerful inside runner with good receiving skills and awareness in pass protection who will be given every opportunity to supplant the one-dimensional LeGarrette Blount as the club's top ball-carrier, and the smallish but speedy David. The Florida native is the prototypical Tampa 2 linebacker, possessing the range and quickness to be effective in coverage while able to tackle well in space. He'll be limited strictly to the weak side, however, because of his modest size.

We were linked by our enjoyment of the outdoors, by our ages — mid- to late-60s — and by a desire to defy frailty of one sort or another.

Stress also seems to affect food preferences.

Sometimes you have to show them how, even if they don't like a certain wine. For example, a wine that goes well with the fried chicken, I may say, "You don't like it, but try it with the chicken where it has enough acidity to cut through the fat." Then they get it.

The Pearl Fryar Topiary Garden is now on my list of top places I want to visit the next time I drive through the South. Until then, I'll have to make do with the website's descriptions of the driveway hedge of dwarf yaupon hollies cut into the letters L-O-V-E, the "Hate Hurts" metal sculpture made of found materials, the mushroom-shaped oaks and the sailing-ship junipers.
Some are obvious, such as the two stone lions that guard the entrance off Point Lobos Avenue and are replicas of relics from Sutro Heights across the way. Some are subtle: The reclaimed redwood siding on the building's east side has the raw simplicity of what critic Lewis Mumford dubbed the "Bay Region Style" in 1947.
Neither freshman Braxton Miller nor senior Terrelle Pryor was the starting quarterback on the first day of Ohio State's spring practice on Thursday, and neither may be the starter when the Buckeyes open the season against Akron on Sept. 3.

Hey, Tony: After listening to Holmgren and Heckert speak, it reiterated my theory as to why the Browns have been so consistently poor since 1999. It starts at the top with Randy Lerner. He has to be the only owner in the entire NFL that is completely invisible to the public. He never speaks out about our lack of success, our dearth of talent, our need to win now, etc., like all of the other owners when their teams fail. I think the fact that he is invisible and doesn't put any pressure on the people below him causes the front office personnel to lack any sense of urgency, which is why we always hear that "it is a process" when we are terrible instead of becoming the 49ers or even the Bengals who became playoff teams in one year.

Meeting a hunky divorced man (Geoff Stults) at a club, Kim tries to up her desirability quotient by claiming her baby is actually Deena's, thereby enlisting her friend in a series of wacky scenarios to maintain the ruse. This dilemma — which arrives far too late in the film to feel like its central conflict — becomes the film's biggest stumbling block, invested as it is with no more personality than an average midseason sitcom plot. The "Must See TV" style is augmented further by the addition of wacky roommate Laura (Rachel Bilson), a virginal Christian with a job as a nude sushi model, given nothing more interesting to do than walk around in skimpy outfits, looking confused.

With "The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence)," everything is gratuitous. Everything seems intended for shock value. It's hard to imagine what other possible intention writer-director Tom Six might have had this time around. It's as if he's saying, "OK, horror fans, you say you can't get enough?

He seemed to step up his game when it mattered most, catching 17 passes for 303 yards and five TDs in his last two bowl games. While Blackmon isn't the fastest receiver in the draft, he has the strength and the moves to create separation at the line of scrimmage and get open. He has excellent hands and catches pretty much everything thrown his direction.

And then there's basketball, with no practice facility and one of the oldest arenas in the country.

Saudi Arabia and other OPEC countries are covering some of the shortfall in Libyan crude, which went mainly to refineries in Europe.

* Angels reliever Jason Isringhausen, Pujols' longtime teammate in St. Louis, recently observed that pitchers were having success pounding Pujols down and in. Izzy is pretty much correct, though Pujols has gotten a couple of hits on low-inside pitches located in the strike zone. Inside pitchers are giving Pujols fits. According to STATS LLC, Pujols is batting .167 on strikes thrown up and in, and .083 on strikes thrown in and at the belt. He is also chasing inside pitches out of the strike zone. Pitchers have thrown him 22 low-inside pitches out of the strike zone, and he's chased 10 of them. He doesn't have a hit on those low-inside balls. Generally speaking it is never a good sign when an aging slugger shows signs of vulnerability when opponents work him inside. Overall Pujols is batting .188 on all inside fastballs, and .154 on inside fastballs thrown by RH pitchers.

Not so much with the incoming freshmen, but the transfer guys. I can’t tell you the number of kids we recruited in the past that really liked us, we really liked them, and they wanted to believe but they didn’t believe. And then when we play them, sure enough, these guys would come up after and say, ‘Coach, I should’ve listened, I should’ve come to you.’ It’s another validation for us.

Khan, a well-known Pakistani scientist, had transferred (for profit) core nuclear weapons technology to Iran, Libya and North Korea — but once confronted, it was not very shocking that they treated Mr. Khan as a national hero, put him under house arrest, and released him after an appallingly short sentence.

On a recent trip to Los Angeles, I met some Howard Dean supporters (and yes, they still identify themselves as such) who were grieving not because of the Democrats' midterm defeat but because they have had to let go of their idyllic notion about what Obama stands for.

There's self pity that leaves you asking: Why is this happening to me? There's self doubt that creeps in after being rejected by yet another employer.

And that figure is true, too. When the city calculates the cost of fire pensions - let's call it "total cost," meaning what the city must budget each year - it includes payments on debt owed. In the mid-2000s, the city shorted the system, claiming it shouldn't have to pay the rising cost of the fire pensions, which are partly controlled by the state legislature.

Today I'll go over the items that I look for on gas connectors while doing home inspections. I'll cover the most common installation defects, and I'll go over the differences between new and old connectors.

On the other hand, Union Station is in downtown, where you don't find a lot of free parking. And it's not too far from other major entertainment venues downtown -- Busch Stadium, Scottrade Center, the Peabody Opera House, etc. So if it did have a free parking lot, Cardinals and Blues fans might end up using it a lot (to the chagrin of other parking lot attendants around town).

An examination of the caloric content of food from about 40 fast-food and sit-down restaurants in three states found that overall the stated calories of items on the menus were accurate.

And his control drove Apple's business model. No screws to open up his devices. Those (patent protected) high margins from aesthetics allow Apple to break a lot of rules. Both the personal-computer industry and the Internet evolved as horizontal industries, layers of companies, each with a sliver of expertise (operating systems, processors, computers), that upended slow moving and formerly ridiculously profitable giants IBM and AT&T. Steve Jobs went horizontal just owning the online delivery layer to transform the music industry. He's trying to do it again to book publishing and TVs and games, and movies.

The expansion of Pacific East from Cleveland Heights to a second shop in Woodmere is a welcome one, something that becomes obvious if you try to snatch a piece of red snapper nigiri sushi from the plate. The rice underneath won't come with it. The plump, glistening piece of fish is just too thick to wrap around anything. What a great problem. And what a perfect symbol for a restaurant that serves plenty of very good cooked Japanese food but continues to place as much, even more, emphasis on sushi.
Even if the 2010 health-care overhaul -- which the pharmaceutical industry supported -- is upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court, there are many aspects of the law still to be worked out.

The 27-song concert had its awkward moments. It took the cautious Taylor a few songs to unwind; King, who has never been a terrific singer, struggled with the higher passages on her uptempo songs. But once Taylor relaxed, his honeyed, conversational delivery was engrossing — “Fire and Rain,” for instance, retains its ability to hypnotize. As for King, a few missed notes didn’t stop her from singing to the rafters, again and again. She’s a soul shouter at heart (which is probably why she was every soul singer’s favorite songwriter in the ’60s), and she roared her way through “I Feel the Earth Move” with glee, stomping around the stage, singing to her musicians and beaming at the crowd.

Innovation persists in good economic times and bad — and for some entrepreneurs that may mean using a coffeehouse with free Wi-Fi as an office. The quest to create new businesses with low-cost and no-cost help in a grim economy has spawned a cottage industry.

Desserts were good, but more delicate than the rustic savory courses. A crostata ($8.50), no bigger around than a coffee cup, was so good I wanted more. I felt similarly about the gooey, rich toffee budino with creme fraiche gelato ($8.50), although it wasn't warm, as advertised, which would have made it even better. I decided not to complain to the server, who was generally efficient and friendly. The staff showed up when needed and offered cogent explanations when asked.

Mr. Romney has his unscripted, inspired moments. Late in South Carolina, a feisty Mr. Romney chastised a heckler—who was slamming him for being the 1%—for seeking to "divide the nation . . . as our President is doing," and then riffed on America's great economic model. Romney strategist Eric Fehrnstrom boasted it was "Mitt Romney at his best." He was right. And it lasted all of 30 seconds. A few days later Mr. Romney was back to borrowing the heckler's language, telling Floridians "the 1% is doing fine. I want to help the 99%."

Monday, for the first time, I heard a clear answer on this subject from a senior administration official. He stated emphatically that the current U.S. troop drawdown from 100,000 to 68,000 troops by September will be the extent of the cuts for a while. They will be completed, according to a plan still being finalized by General Allen, and the situation then assessed further this fall, before any additional reductions are planned. U.S. and other NATO troops will still complete their main mission by 2014, but there will be no rush for the exits in the meantime.
Cut.

We donated a lot of her things to her church and Goodwill. I am glad to know that such a caring person has something that belonged to our daughter. We would like you to keep it if you want.

If you do not wish to have them, please send them to us and we will gladly pay any postage due. Thank you. Nancy May."

Like its predecessor, it feels more juvenile than, say, the 1959 version of “Journey to the Center of the Earth,” but back then I was more juvenile too, so it may be just me. Its virtues rest mainly in the casting. The kids are indeed all right, and the always-welcome Caine gets points by now just for being Caine.

And around the time of the appeal, Ho and Iorio asked a man to strike up a conversation with Hilow at her pub and record it. They wanted the man to ask Hilow specifically what she disliked about Sweethearts. Ho and Iorio recently gave me a copy of that tape, recorded in April 2011. On it, Hilow -- with little prompting -- can be clearly heard making vile and racist remarks about both Asians and blacks.
By now, the news of the impending closure of Cleveland Clinic's Huron Hospital has been broadly reported, and the predictable and understandable reactions of uncertainty and feeling of abandonment have been expressed by a variety of sources throughout Greater Cleveland. Many feel the loss of Huron Hospital is the equivalent to losing health care access for the residents of East Cleveland and surrounding areas. I'd like to suggest it is the beginning of a new investment in the health of those who used Huron Hospital as their primary source of health care.

When I first talked to them about where I was, I think it surprised them. I don't think even they saw the level at which I was getting burned out.

WHO'S AFFECTED
Pole position: Danielle and her friends go to Squeeze Lounge for some stripper pole lessons: "Since Steve, I've had problems feeling comfortable with any part of my body at all." Really? Hustler has evidence to the contrary. Danny Provenzano happens to be there as well; he's apparently joined the "crusade" to get Danielle back onto the dating scene. We're sure he has a few friends who are Danielle's speed. Kim takes the first crack at the stripper pole. She's in pretty good shape, but straddling a stripper pole in black booty shorts and knee-high boots is not a good look for her. And mind you, she has a 20-something son who is undoubtedly watching ... and cringing. Cue the sexy saxophone music, it's Danielle's turn. She humps the pole, shakes her tush at the boys, and does a split, and the next thing you know, Danielle's got her groove back. "This what worked for the father of my children. You saw my house, right?"
Xcel Energy, which owns the Sherco power plant near Becker, is required to add controls on the plant's two oldest units, but not expensive SCR technology.

Learning to make pastries may have saved Martinez's life, or at least spared him a stretch in the state penitentiary. In 2005, facing three felony charges, Martinez promised to enroll in a pastry-making program, leading to a reduced sentence  and perhaps a last chance at an honest life.
As the Annie E. Casey Foundation reports, for example, three times as many African-American children live in poverty, compared with white children. One in five rural children lives in poverty, too. And one-third of America's children are in families where no parent has a full-time job. None of these statistics makes for compelling television, I realize.
A little farther north on Palos Verdes Drive, you'll reach at a grand blufftop chunk of land that longtime Angelenos will remember as site of the Marineland theme park from 1954-1987. Since 2009, these 102 acres have been the site of Terranea, a luxury resort that opened just in time to get kicked in the teeth by the recession. It has 582 hotel rooms (each at least 450 square feet) and rates that begin around $360, with a nine-hole golf course, spa, three pools, multiple restaurants and views of the Point Vicente lighthouse (next to which is the Point Vicente Interpretive Center, a prime whale-watching spot). Terranea is not a beach hotel – it's all about bluffs, rocks and pebbles. And if you're splurging, it's worth a thought. If you're not splurging, come anyway and grab a free parking spot (first lot on the left as you enter). Make the rounds on the well-appointed clifftop public trails and wind up around sunset at the casual resort restaurant that looks out toward the lighthouse. It's called Nelson's—an homage to Mike Nelson, the heroic SCUBA diver portrayed by Lloyd Bridges on television's "Sea Hunt" from 1958-61. The show was shot around here, in glorious black and white, and the restaurant walls are filled with posters (in jarring color) promoting ancient episodes. Give them a look. Then glance again to the sea, take a bite of seared ahi, and be glad. To be any more immersed in SoCal culture, you'd have to strap on air tanks and flip overboard backwards.

"The periphery has been strengthened at a time when the north has been weakened," says Mujtaba Rahman, an analyst with Eurasia Group in New York.

New York Fed President William Dudley also did not believe the economy was sliding back into recession.
The group had been kicking around since 1978 without much notice before it belatedly hit its stride with the release of the 1995 album, "Different Class," which launched four top-ten singles. But it was only after singer Jarvis Cocker stormed the stage and mooned the crowd during Michael Jackson's performance at the Brit Awards a year later that Pulp's infamy was forever secured.
Thompson, the No. 4 overall pick, has shown promise as a defender, rebounder and shot blocker. His offensive game remains raw.

The initiative also would set up a new state authority to oversee the spending of this money -- which would be dedicated for alternative fuels no matter what other pressing priorities or long-term needs exist in this state. Another serious flaw in the initiative is its attempt to exempt this new authority from existing state contracting laws -- such as competitive bidding -- and certain conflict-of-interest rules, such as whether a board member could award funding to an employer or a company in which he or she held stock.
At least three big questions hang heavy over the state's current workforce and its 296,000 job seekers:
Then there's "Elizabeth," a 62-year-old Democratic Senate candidate from Massachusetts. Like Barack's white girlfriend, she couldn't be black. She would if she could, but she couldn't. But she could be a composite – a white woman and an Indian woman, all mixed up in one! Not Indian in the sense of Ashton Kutcher putting on brownface makeup and a fake-Indian accent in his amusing new commercial for the hip lo-fat snack Popchips. But Indian in the sense of checking the "Are you Native American?" box on the Association of American Law Schools form, which Elizabeth Warren did for much of her adult life. According to her, she's part Cherokee and part Delaware. Not in the Joe Biden sense, I hasten to add, but Delaware in the sense of the Indian tribe named in honor of the home state of Big F—kin' Chief Dances With Plugs.

Barack Obama has written that during his very brief sojourn in the private sector he felt like "a spy behind enemy lines." Puzder knows what it feels like when gargantuan government is composed of multitudes of regulators who regard business as the enemy. And 25.4 million Americans who are unemployed, underemployed or too discouraged to look for employment know what it feels like to be collateral damage in the regulatory state's war on business.

Though few of his paintings were valued at his death for as much as $10,000, a decade ago, his Media Arts company (which was once a publicly traded firm) took in as much as $120 million a year from more than 4,500 dealers around the country. The dealers sold Kinkade prints, books, collector’s plates and other ephemera, as well as paintings. Much of this activity was promoted by Kinkade’s proclaimed Christian beliefs, but by far, the biggest spur to his 21st-century success was a booming housing market.

I was actually hoping to hear from Ron Paul. He seems quirky enough to hold a conversation, pretending for a moment that it would be him doing the calling. He even looks a tad like a March hare or a mad hatter. I think candidates should look the part they are playing. It would be less confusing for voters who don’t have the time or the inclination to learn about them.So, what is a mad hatter, anyway?
Better yet, it's starting to do something about it. Starting next week, the utility intends to send out spotters to verify repairs before they're checked off the to-do list, said James Ferguson, the city's streetlight chief.

What Mike performed was based on the assumption that Mike was telling the truth. He spoke in the first person. He gave detailed accounts of many things he witnessed. He made it seem like it was happening—to him. And he didn't give me (or probably anyone else) the idea he kind of saw something. That's the show. If you said, "Some of these things are real and some aren't," you wouldn't have a show. You'd just have a sort of opinion, which people hear on cable news every day. Who cares about that?

Wright focuses sections of her book on Islamic youth culture as an instrument of change. Young Muslims, she finds, do not believe their religion requires them to live by rules that have more to do with the practices of a patriarchal 7th-century society than the teachings of the Koran. But many of them are also "strikingly religious and observant." They want to lead modern lives, and they want democratic accountability from their governments, but that doesn't mean they think the secular West has all the answers.

I thought the a la carte sides ($6) might be another highlight - after all, these local veggies have just come out of the ground. But two of the three I sampled didn't bring anything extra to the meal: The padrone peppers were fiery enough to overwhelm any main dish; and the greens were bitter enough to make your hair curl. Only sweet roasted sunchokes - tubers that look like gnarled ginger - made a happy impression.

Sarkozy has been unafraid to employ French military forces: He put France alongside Britain, under Prime Minister David Cameron, in a leading role in the NATO-led air campaign that helped topple Gadhafi last year.

Virtually all had been super achievers, whether it was in the corporate world or as independent businesspeople, lawyers, inventors or entrepreneurs. The majority traveled with spouses. Money and politics were never discussed.

· Buy and fly on the right days. The adage goes, "Tuesday is the best day to buy, and Wednesday is the best day to fly." This is because most airfare sales begin Tuesday, and most other airlines have price-matched by the afternoon. Wednesday is the least crowded and cheapest day to fly because most business travelers and families are settled for the week and gearing up for weekend travel. Booking a Friday or Sunday flight is likely to increase the overall price, with potential to double the cost.

Michael Fleming is a Raleigh, N.C.-based "mercury-free" dentist who hasn't used amalgam in his practice for 28 years. He never guarantees that removing amalgam will improve health and advises of potential drawbacks: tooth sensitivity, potential future need of a root canal if there's nerve damage in the process, the increased release of mercury vapors during removal and the cost, which can range from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars. He typically doesn't recommend it for very ill people or those with life-threatening medical conditions.

And the fact that Baltimore leaders' concerns tend toward the parochial doesn't make them altogether invalid. University of Maryland-Baltimore leaders have historically played a major role in Baltimore civic affairs, particularly in the efforts to redevelop the city's west side. If the president of a combined institution was in College Park — a safe bet — he or she wouldn't have the same on-the-ground view of the community around the Baltimore campus and wouldn't likely be invested in the same way in its success.

This production is also especially good at expertly building tension around situations (like the long-awaited Potter-Voldemort showdown) that anyone who knows the books knows the outcome of. Another satisfaction, and the key to creating emotion, is the kind of strong acting that the end of a story often calls forth. Though many do well (including an especially effective John Hurt as wand maker Ollivander), it is Alan Rickman as the elusive Severus Snape who, as always, makes the most lasting impression.

Beware north winds and large waves this weekend. Western Lake Erie walleye fishing has been best, with good numbers of spawning fish caught from the shallow reef areas on lead-head jigs and off the reefs while trolling minnow-style plugs, as well as west of Catawba Island. The best areas for trolling have been deep water on the outside of the reefs off Camp Perry and the Davis-Besse power plant. Brisk west winds this week had slowed the fishing on top of the reefs, but Crib and Locust reefs could rebound today.

"Even Jimmy Carter would have given that order," scoffed Romney in response. But he shouldn't be so quick to denigrate the former Democratic president, who entered the Navy during World War II and then served as a submarine officer until his honorable discharge in 1953.

The fallout from the Japanese disaster was sufficient enough to force evacuation of large swaths of that nation's east coast. And while Iodine 131 has a half-life of about a month -- meaning it wasn't a threat for long unless fish or crustaceans concentrated it much more heavily than was found in the kelp they ate -- the cesium detected so far in lower concentrations lasts much longer and will likely remain in sea life for more than 30 years.
State and county authorities are increasingly concerned that a large portion of homeowners pursuing sinkhole claims are using insurance proceeds to pay off mortgages, rather than make repairs.

Reza has expressed frustration that her popular plays have been delivered as razor-sharp comedies, and she seems to have found an ally in Polanski, who makes no effort to punch up the wry ironies of the dialogue.

Mike Lopresti, USA Today: "Brown is, without question, one of the premier teachers of the game of his time. But he has also tended to wander off. Not every man can say he has been head coach for 30 percent of the NBA teams, or held the position for 13 pro or college teams in all four time zones of the U.S. mainland. Matter of fact, this is the 40th anniversary of him resigning at Davidson - without coaching a game.

On the plus side of the House budget committee's ledger, the Republican rewrite, or "substitute," musters $100 million to encourage Ohio communities to share services or merge.

On March 3, the school district will sell this property to The 1759 Vought House, A Revolutionary War Loyalist Homestead, Inc. for the historically significant sum of $17.76. In the spring of 1776, New Jersey's Governor William Franklin, recently estranged from his father Benjamin, did everything he could to quell the rebellion in this province. In June, with thousands of British troops about to land in New York, tensions ran high throughout the Jerseys. Christopher Vought – who built this house in 1759 – and his son John Vought were friends with their neighbor, militia captain Thomas Jones. But when the local militia company refused to turn out to prepare for the defense of New York, John Vought was blamed and New Jersey’s patriot Congress demanded that he appear before them and explain the company's refusal. Instead, John led a mob of two dozen club-wielding loyalists in an attack on his neighbor, Captain Thomas Jones. This angry mob chased Jones into his house, where he hid, and his wife and children out into the yard. These loyalists were later arrested. Militia marched from Whitehouse and surrounded the Vought house late one night. When the colonel rapped on the front door with the hilt of his sword, the man they sought slipped out a window in his nightshirt and was captured. The loyalists were fined and released in early July, just as the Declaration of Independence was being read in towns across the new State of New Jersey.

I want to love the restaurant, and I recognize the artistry on every plate, but I left thinking that some classics need to be left alone. For example, the rabbit au civet ($17) was basically a scaled-down version of a hearty dish, shrunk to a barely there appetizer, with cubes of meat in a heavy demi-glace on one side and soft polenta mounted with Ossau-Iraty cheese on the other. I'd either like more bells and whistles to make it a new dish or a bigger portion so I could savor its rustic goodness.

* It’s impossible to evaluate Nick Markakis so far in 2012. He looked great in his first two games – two homers, four RBIs – and then had no homers and one RBI in his next 13 games before his three-RBI day Sunday. The guy is coming off major abdominal surgery and was sick most of the past week. The last player who has tried to come back so quickly from abdominal surgery – Washington’s Ryan Zimmerman in 2011 – didn’t hit his weight in his first month back last season. Eventually, Zimmerman returned to being Zimmerman. Markakis is going to be under more scrutiny, though, because his offensive production has been an issue the past two years.

The other kind is the one that speaks to a desire for rudimentary dance-floor schlock — the kind of schlock intense enough to batter down national and cultural barriers. Few were willing to defend "Macarena" when it was sweeping the globe, but radio stations couldn’t stop playing it, and pop fans couldn’t stop dancing to it. These songs are, simultaneously, runaway chart successes and cultural jokes. Even as we’re doing the steps, we recognize that there’s something slightly embarrassing about the way we fell for the big beat. It speaks to the collective frailty of the human psyche, and how easily manipulated it is.

The Institute's report refutes that notion big time locally and dispels other myths that fuel anti-immigrant sentiment. Some 1.8 million Latinos live in metropolitan Chicago - that's 22 percent of the population, according to the report. The study goes on to say that those Latinos - the U.S. citizens as well as the undocumented - add $5 billion in tax revenues, while $3.9 billion is spent on providing public services (education, public safety, health care) to them. That results in them adding $1.2 billion more in tax revenues than they use.
The Freedom School which LeFevre and others started in the summer of 1957 taught the same basic philosophy that the Hoiles' presented on their editorial pages. Harry was largely responsible (in several indirect sorts of ways) for helping get the school started. He allowed LeFevre to take time off from his job at the newspaper (with the proviso that the school did not interfere with his writing productivity) and he lent the school $7000, which it needed during its very early days. Once the school was going, both R.C. and Harry made substantial financial contributions to it. They also sent a number of their editors and family members to the school. During the summer of 1963, R.C. attended. That same summer a number of his children, grandchildren, in-laws, and editors also were students at the Freedom School.

The metaphoric weight of a ship journey is impossible to avoid — all of these people are caught between worlds, between old lives and an uncertain future. Today's traveler sees a 12-hour plane flight as an annoying interruption, a dead space best handled with iPods, magazines, movies and a nap. But on a journey like this one, a three-week voyage through three oceans (Indian, Mediterranean, Atlantic) and two seas (Red and Arabian), life is still lived and lessons are still learned — especially by our narrator, named Michael (though not the author, Ondaatje tells us in a note), who made the trip to join his mother in London when he was 11.

"From the perspective of politics and clout, one of the things that is problematic is that you just don't have an organization that stands for the middle class," said Solon Simmons, a sociologist and assistant professor who specializes in American politics at George Mason University's School for Conflict Analysis and Resolution in Virginia. "You've got lobbying groups that stand for various corporations, various interest groups, various business segments, but you don't really have a middle-class organization like workers once had unions. You've got the (national seniors organization) AARP, but it doesn't stand specifically for the middle class. And without that kind of organization, you're simply unlikely to get much bang for your buck in Washington, D.C."

Cars.com puts it this way in its 2011 AMI report: "In today's global economy, there's no easy way to determine just how American a car is. Many cars built in the U.S., for example, are assembled using parts that come from elsewhere. Some cars assembled in the U.S. from largely American-made parts don't sell well, meaning fewer Americans are employed to build them. Cars.com's American-Made Index recognizes cars that are built here, have a high amount of domestic parts and are bought in large numbers by American consumers."
